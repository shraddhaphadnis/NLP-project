BP s CEO Tony Hayward reckons the $ 100 million cost of drilling a well to divert the flow from a leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is the biggest hit the oil major will take in the Deepwater Horizon tragedy . 
The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded last week , and sank , with the loss of 11 workers , who are now presumed dead , while the well it was drilling is leaking 1,000 barrels of crude a day into the sea . 
Investors will hope Hayward is right but BP s record on estimating the costs of major accidents gives rise for concern . 
In 2005 , when an explosion at BP s Texas City refinery killed 15 workers , BP initially scoffed at analyst estimates the cost of repairs , lost profits and damages could hit $ 1 billion . 
Spokespeople predicted the impact would be a fraction of that . 
In the end , compensation claims cost over $ 2 billion while repair costs and lost profits cost over $ 1 billion more . 
Investors may have this in mind when they pushed BP s shares down around 3 percent in the past 2 days , wiping over $ 5 billion off the company s market capitalization , despite the company reporting a forecast-busting first quarter earnings rise .
