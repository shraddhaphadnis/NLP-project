NEW YORK , April 30 | Fri Apr 30 , 2010 10:43 am EDT NEW YORK , April 30 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Containment and cleanup costs of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could top $ 3 billion , but financial impacts on BP Plc will be limited by the oil company 's insurance , Fitch Ratings said on Friday .

L -RRB- -LRB- BP . 
N -RRB- exploded in flames on April 20 and collapsed two days later , leading to a massive oil spill that threatened to become the worst U.S. ecological disaster ever . 
The spreading oil has deepened fears of severe damage to fisheries , wildlife refuges and tourism in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . 
Shrimp fishermen in Louisiana have filed a class action lawsuit against BP , accusing it of negligence . 
`` The ultimate financial impact on BP will depend on how the environmental and economic impact develops when the spill reaches land , '' Fitch said in a statement . 
Costs could be more than $ 3 billion , depending on how long it takes to arrest the flow of oil into the Gulf , Jeffrey Woodruff , senior director in Fitch 's energy team in London , said in the statement . 
Insurance will likely cover the majority of BP 's costs , limiting rating pressure , Fitch said . 
It now rates BP AA-plus , just one notch below its top rating of AAA . 
There are precedents for assessing the potential impacts , Fitch said . 
In the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill , when about 250,000 barrels of crude oil were spilled into Prince William Sound , Alaska , cleanup costs were an estimated $ 2 billion , Fitch said . 
Exxon was eventually found liable for actual damages of about $ 287 million and compensatory damages of about $ 500 million after a series of appeals spanning nearly 20 years , Fitch said . 
Exxon was originally assessed punitive damages of $ 5 billion but a US Supreme Court ruling in 2003 imposed limits on punitive damages , helping reduce Exxon 's liability , Fitch said . 
Assuming the BP oil spill is worse than the Exxon Valdez accident , as environmentalists are now claiming , and it takes an additional 60 to 90 days to drill a relief well and stop the leak , the total spill could be about 1 million barrels , Fitch said . 
Fitch said it will take rating action if necessary because of significant increases in BP 's estimated environmental or litigation costs .

BP or its insurers may even owe the Transocean insurers money for the rig itself .

That is always the case . 
BP , not Transocean hired Haliburton , and paid for and took responsibility for maintenance of all equipment on the rig , including the emergency capping system .

The news will shortly be that BP bought the whole problem when they rented the rig for their own production , not Transocean .

Stay away from BP . 
The government has already hinted multiple times , it is BP 's ultimate and clear responsibility . 
That will continue to be the fact published , and more so when Transocean lawyers shortly come to its defense in the press , showing the hold harmess agreements . 
Selling RIG now is an great error . 
Buying BP was a mistake one just has to live with . 
A bad way for Cramer to come to BP 's defense . 
We will see during May-July the published hold harmless agreements holding Transocean harmless . 
I am considering buying Transocean today . 
Last days perhaps to do this before Transocean comes to its defense and shows the clear hold harmess agreements to the news and public , which obviously exist . 
This is a very important post .
