LONDON | Mon Jun 28 , 2010 9:15 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP said it had spent $ 300 million on its Gulf of Mexico oil spill response effort in the past three days , hitting the $ 100 million\/day spend rate for the first time and bringing its total bill to $ 2.65 billion so far . 
The figures , which BP released in a statement on Monday , include the cost of trying to cap the well , clean up the environmental damage caused by the leaking crude and pay compensation to those affected by the spill . 
BP added it remained on track to complete its relief well , which aims to kill the leaking well at the point it meets the reservoir , in the three month timeframe initially envisaged , despite progress slowing on the well in recent days . 
Last week , the well was being drilled at the rate of 1,000 feet per day , but the pace dropped to less than 100 feet a day over the weekend , as the delicate task of closing in on the leaking well is conducted .
