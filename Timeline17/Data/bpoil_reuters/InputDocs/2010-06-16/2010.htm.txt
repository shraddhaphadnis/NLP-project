WASHINGTON | Wed Jun 16 , 2010 2:59 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc 's chairman apologized on Wednesday to the American people for the catastrophic oil spill on the Gulf coast . 
The company also said it would forgo paying dividends to its shareholders this year . 
Emerging from a meeting with President Barack Obama , BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg promised to look after people affected by the spill and to repair damage to the environment . 
`` We have agreed today with the president a framework that should assure the American people that we mean what we say , '' Svanberg told reporters . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Perhaps Obama should also apologize for his administration 's role -LRB- or lack of -RRB- . 
BP was always concerned about `` bottom-line-profits '' & expediency NOT the health and welfare of their lowly employees nor the ecology of this Earth ! 
That just hurts more innocent people who have invested in the company and worked for them . 
There are 23 thousand USA employees working for BP as well as all the contractors . 
I was one of them but cuts and the economy forced me out . 
The bottom line is `` it sucks '' but its done and now we need to prepare for the next spill . 
It will happen again that is for sure . 
I also think all the people complaining should stop joy riding in there F150 's or Harleys . 
We made these Oil Monsters and now we cry about them .
