\* Brazil may pick up rigs idled on moratorium \* Could help the country 's offshore campaign \* Deep water rigs in tight supply around the world By Brian Ellsworth and Joshua Schneyer RIO DE JANEIRO , June 11 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brazil could benefit from the BP Gulf of Mexico spill as a U.S. moratorium on offshore drilling boosts available rigs for the country 's deep water oil exploration program . 
Even as an ecological catastrophe makes the future of U.S. offshore drilling less certain , Brazil is plowing ahead with a $ 220 billion five-year plan to tap oil fields even deeper than BP 's -LRB- BP . 
L -RRB- ill-fated Gulf well , which is still leaking crude . 
With an estimated 35 rigs idled in the Gulf of Mexico , Brazil is already receiving inquiries from companies looking to move their rigs here , where vast discoveries in recent years may soon turn the country into a major crude exporter . 
`` What is bad for some may be good for others , '' said Fernando Martins , Latin America Vice President for GE Oil and Gas , which provides services to drillers in Brazil . 
`` Since operators are shutting down at least temporarily in the U.S. Gulf , some companies are planning to move their rigs to Brazil now , '' he said , without offering details .

Brazil 's state oil company Petrobras -LRB- PETR4 . 
SA -RRB- -LRB- PBR . 
N -RRB- , which already produces around a quarter of the world 's deep water oil , could be an obvious candidate to take newly available rigs . 
Petrobras declined to comment on the issue . 
But Mauricio Tolmasquim , a top Brazilian government energy advisor , said this week that he expected the Gulf spill to benefit Petrobras by making more deep water rigs available -- adding that cost savings could be offset by higher insurance premiums for drilling operations . 
Brazilian officials , including government leaders and Petrobras executives , have said Brazil has no intention of slowing its offshore development as a result of the spill . 
Analysts say oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico -- most notably BP and Chevron -LRB- CVX . 
N -RRB- -- may have to decide between paying standby fees while the rigs are idle , moving them to other projects , or canceling the contracts . 
The U.S. moratorium may last longer than six months because of U.S. sentiment against offshore drilling and plans for an overhaul of safety standards . 
This could provide further incentives to move rigs to Brazil or West Africa , which together with the Gulf of Mexico have over the last five years been the principal areas of deep water exploration . 
`` The largest question investors should ask is whether the moratorium is lifted after six months or will there be a much greater delay , '' said UBS analysts in a research note . 
Production from deep waters has doubled over the last decade to reach 9 percent of the world 's total as easy-to-reach onshore oil fields dry up , according to industry estimates , boosting demand for deep water rigs beyond the pace of production . 
This rapid deep water growth may leave oil majors unwilling to cancel rig contracts , despite the expense of keeping them idle , for fear of losing rigs they need down the road . 
`` If I 'm Chevron , I know I 've got Petrobras looking over my shoulder , and if I cancel that rig I 'm taking the chance that I might not get it back , '' said Kurt Hallead , an analyst with RBC Capital Markets , who covers oil services . 
Petrobras , which pumps the vast majority of Brazil 's crude , said in its 2009 business plan that it would lease eight deep water drilling rigs this year and a total of 14 in 2011 and 2012 . 
By 2013 it will begin receiving the first of 28 new rigs to be built in Brazil by local shipyards , giving it a fleet of more than 60 deep water rigs by 2017 . 
UBS estimates that there are currently 23 ultra-deep water drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico . 
This type of rig could be attractive to Petrobras or other major oil companies operating offshore Brazil . 
`` Who could benefit from the moratorium ? 
Petrobras ... should benefit as some U.S. -LRB- Gulf of Mexico -RRB- rigs begin looking for new markets at a time when Petrobras is tendering for a large number of deepwater rigs , '' UBS said .
