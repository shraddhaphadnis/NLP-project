Factbox : The Gulf BP spill : How much oil is it , anyway ? 
How much oil has spewed so far ? 
On Day 53 of the worst U.S. oil spill in U.S. history , it 's equivalent to : \* Just over 2.5 hours worth of U.S. oil consumption . 
The United States is the world 's biggest oil user , and burns about 20 million barrels a day , or 833,000 barrels an hour . 
Every 21 days , the BP well spews one hour 's worth of U.S. consumption . 
\* Eight times as much oil as the amount spilled when the Exxon Valdez tanker plowed into a reef in Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989 , spilling 257,000 barrels . 
BP 's well spews the equivalent to one Exxon Valdez tanker every 6.4 days . 
\* About 135 Olympic-sized swimming pools . 
An Olympic pool holds 15,725 barrels of oil , versus the 2.12 million barrels of oil the well has spewed . 
\* About 360 million quarts , if the oil was packaged in plastic cans sold at gas stations .

-LRB- somebody check my math , please : 365\/21 = 17.3 -RRB- gee , how awesome is it that we 've ruined the gulf for decades for 17 hours worth of oil consumption . 
One quart of oil can pollute a low ball estimate of 150,000 gallons of water as a micron thick oil slick . 
Put that into perspective . 
Before this is over ... BP will filed for bankruptcy protection ... then everyone will be screwed !
