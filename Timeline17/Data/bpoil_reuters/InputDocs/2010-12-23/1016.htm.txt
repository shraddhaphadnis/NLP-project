Thu Dec 23 , 2010 7:59 pm EST LOS ANGELES -LRB- Hollywood Reporter -RRB- - In the midst of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by BP drilling rig , Deepwater Horizon , a number of news outlets got a bunch of yuks with news that Kevin Costner was the potential savior for the crisis -- that his company , CINC -LRB- `` Costner in Nevada Corporation '' -RRB- , had developed a technology that separated oil from water . 
In a new lawsuit filed in Louisiana District Court on Wednesday , actor Stephen Baldwin and a friend named Spyridon Contogouris claim they were tricked into selling shares of the company that marketed CINC 's technology . 
According to the complaint , Contogouris was approached in the early 2000s by Costner 's representatives to market the actor 's technology to various customers . 
He says he entered into an agreement in which he would receive a commission on sales of units . 
Flash forward to April 17 , 2010 . 
Costner and Contogouris had a meal together in Biloxi , Mississippi , where Costner 's band , Modern West , was playing a gig . 
By that time , says the complaint , Costner 's attempts to market his technology had proven unsuccessful , and he sold all his rights and ownership in CINC to a man named Bret Shelton . 
Three days after Costner and Contogouris had gotten together , Deepwater Horizon exploded , which would eventually lead to the leak of nearly 5 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before the wellhead was capped . 
Contogouris knew it was a big opportunity for CINC . 
He says he attempted to contact Costner , but could n't , because the actor was filming a movie in Canada .
