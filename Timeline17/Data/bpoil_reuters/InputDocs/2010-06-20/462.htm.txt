S. Coast Guard\/Handout LONDON | Sun Jun 20 , 2010 8:50 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP -LRB- BP . 
L -RRB- is planning to raise $ 50 billion to cover the cost of the largest oil spill in U.S. history , London 's Sunday Times reported without citing sources . 
The paper said BP planned to raise $ 10 billion from a bond sale , $ 20 billion from banks and $ 20 billion from asset sales over the next two years . 
The oil major had said last week that it would suspend dividends and increase the pace of asset sales to $ 10 billion this year . 
A spokesman for the group would not confirm any numbers on Sunday , when asked about the Sunday Times report .

It definitely means no dividend for the next few years I have for weeks tried to urge people in government and the media to hire our own super-tankers and surround the well at a safe distance and pump surface oil onboard to be processed at facilities onshore . 
We must have tanker capacity to keep up with the flow rate until the well is secured . 
New Orleans is a deep water port . 
The oil spill is not BP 's problem . 
It is however clearly their fault . 
The problem is now ours to deal with . 
The ex-president of Shell Oil suggested this weeks ago on CNN but was apparently ignored . 
The Saudis used super tankers and retrieved 80 % of their oil spill . 
They were also smart enough to know that the use of dispersants would render the oil unretrievable . 
The myriad of US agencies involved in this spill are not proceeding in a unified direction ... ... . 
they are just posturing while dolphins wash up on shore . 
The Coast Guard can coordinate the super tanker operations instead of counting life jackets on barges employed to block oil from the sensitive Louisiana marshes . 
That Allen should have a talk with his over zealous personnel as to what their priorities should be . 
Get the oil off the water now or should we wait for a tropical storm in the Gulf , Sir ? 
For a company with Approx 473 blatant oil rig violations for drilling and Exxon 1 violation , I would say Hayward deserves all he is getting . . 
BP is continuing to use DISPERSANTS FOR TOXIC OIL TO REDUCE THEIR LIBILITY . 
Dispersing the TOXIC OIL to the water column may do MUCH , MUCH more damage then that of the collected oil that floats on top of the water . 
WHY DOESN T BP STOP THE FLOW OF OIL NOW ? 
WHAT IF A HURRICANNE COMES ? 
All present collection efforts will be lost ! 
WHY IS BP BANKING ON TWO DANGEROUS RELIEF WELLS TO STOP THE OIL ? 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SUPER DANGEROUS RELIEF WELLS DON T WORK ? 
After all , the pressure is 9000 PSI . 
How are they going to cement AND CAP THAT ? 
MANY PEOPLE THINK IT WILL NOT WORK , I AM ONE OF THEM . 
IF THEY ARE PLANNING TWO RELIEF WELLS AND BOTH FAIL , THE GULF COULD BE LOOKING AT 180,000 BARRELS A DAY OF RAW UNSTOPPABLE TOXIC OIL INTO THE GULF WATERS AND BEYOND . 
IF BP CAN T STOP THE OIL FROM SPEWING , WHAT MAKES ANYONE THINK DRILLING TWO RELIEF WELLS WILL WORK TO STOP THE OIL FLOW ? 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO STEP IN WITH AND ASSEMBLED PANEL OF THE BEST OIL RIG ENGINEERS AND MAKE SURE BP IS 100 % CORRECT ON THEIR ASSUMPTIONS . 
THERE CAN BE NO MISJUDGEMENTS OR MISCALCULATIONS ON PUNCHING THROUGH MASSIVE PRESSURES WITH THE RELIEF WELLS !
