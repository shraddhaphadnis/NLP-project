Nassim N Taleb has been twittering about the BP oil spill . 
Here is one of his tweets from today : My expl of BP spill in The Black Swan II : `` do n't give the manager of a nuclear plant an incentive bonus based on cost savings '' . 
I spoke with Nassim and asked him to expound upon his tweet . 
Here is what Nassim wrote me : Because security analysts and investment `` experts '' do n't understand robustness and redundancy , managers have an incentive to hide risks of blowups , Black Swan exposures , by cutting corners they get better numbers and appear cosmetically to be profitable while sitting on dynamite . 
This is not too different from banks stashing their portfolios with more and more hidden risks . 
So this condition of increased fragility over time comes from the incentive system and the bogus risk measures and empirically invalid business school techniques used by analysts . 
A manager collects annual bonuses , and does not pay back his past compensation in the event of a blowup . 
There is a mismatch between the bonus frequency and the time to eventual blowup . 
The tragedy is that , in this case , as with banks , there are externalities and shareholders are not the ones footing the bill , but society at large . 
More can be found about the 10 rules for a black swan robust society in Nassim 's second edition of The Black Swan . 
And by an extended logic : `` rats work harder when the rewards are unpredictable -LRB- B.F. Skinner , Psychologist -RRB- '' . 
No wonder the risk-hiding tendency is matched by legendary hours spent at work that some industries have become famous for ! 
So , a limitless incentive linked to irrelevant metric - -RRB- more risk cover ups - -RRB- longer hours worked . 
Everybody is happy until the unthinkable happens ! 
It 's too bad for America that administrations have `` special interests '' advisors -LRB- Paulson , Geithner -RRB- . 
Wall Street pays out billions in bonuses and over paid execs ... Oil companies post record profits while receiving tax breaks and subsidies ... Each year , an estimated 443,000 people die prematurely from smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke , and another 8.6 million have a serious illness caused by smoking while the US govt subsidizes tobacco ! 
This things also happen due to the wrong understanding of what is `` optimization '' . 
Sometimes , to cut costs means to increase them at some areas in the company and reduce in others . 
The whole optimization does not means to optimize all parts of the system . 
Nic is right on again , the alignment of incentives and outcomes is skewed towards risk for others and rewards for uninvolved . 
Derivatives on food is a perfect example , over 80 percent of the people that buy wheat on the market never intend to take delivery , so farmers and bakers are being squeezed by greedy jerks in suits . 
We should dump them into a harvester or pass laws so that they ca n't ove food prices with speculation . 
Either one works for me . 
Good job , Katharine . 
I agree with Jack C. Insanity ! 
But I can rest easier knowing LeBron James will rake in close to $ 17 million during his first season with the Heat . 
There 's good news . 
We sure have our priorities in order .
