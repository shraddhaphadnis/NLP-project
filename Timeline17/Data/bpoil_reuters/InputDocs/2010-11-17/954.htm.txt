WASHINGTON | Wed Nov 17 , 2010 11:50 am EST WASHINGTON Nov 17 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The initial results of two major probes into the causes of the BP -LRB- BP . 
L -RRB- oil spill have been released since last week . 
The latest account of events that led to the nation 's largest offshore oil spill is from the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council . 
-LRB- ID : nN16159282 -RRB- The scientific panel charged that BP , its contractors , and the government failed to identify critical mistakes that may have caused the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig . 
Its final report is due out next June . 
Last week , the White House oil spill commission also unveiled its preliminary findings , tying the accident to a series of errors by BP and its partners . 
The commission is set to release its final report in January . 
-LRB- ID : nN08212171 -RRB- Following are some of the key conclusions of both reports : - Accident precipitated by decision to proceed to temporarily abandon well , despite indications from negative pressure tests that indicated problems with well integrity . 
- Decision to move ahead with completing project was compounded by delays in realizing natural gas was flowing in well and riser and failure to take timely well-control actions . 
- Decisions to move ahead despite warning signs indicate `` insufficient consideration of risk and a lack of operating discipline . '' 
- There were insufficient checks and balances for decisions regarding schedule and procedures for well abandonment and considerations for well safety . 
- BP , its contractors , and the government did not identify or correct critical mistakes . 
- Failures indicate the lack of a suitable approach for anticipating and managing the inherent risks , uncertainties , and dangers associated with deepwater drilling operations . 
- Other factors that may have contributed to accident include BP 's decision to use long string well design , use of only six centralizers on casing and not running bond log to assess cement integrity in well . 
- Proceeding to remove drilling mud from well without installing lockdown sleeve on production casing wellhead seals may have also contributed to accident . 
WHITE HOUSE OIL SPILL COMMISSION INITIAL FINDINGS - Cement -LRB- potentially contaminated or displaced by other materials -RRB- failed to isolate hydrocarbons . 
- Pre-job laboratory data should have prompted redesign of cement slurry used in well . 
- Cement evaluation tools -LRB- such as a cement bond log -RRB- might have identified cementing failure , but most operators would not have run tools at that time . 
- Negative pressure tests repeatedly showed problems with the integrity of the primary cement job , but BP and Transocean personnel treated test as complete success . 
- BP 's temporary abandonment procedures introduced additional risk to project . 
- Once rig crew recognized influx of hydrocarbons , there were several options that might have prevented or delayed the explosion and\/or shut in the well . 
- No evidence at this time to suggest there was a conscious decision to sacrifice safety concerns to save money . 
- There was a failure to develop or adopt clear procedures for crucial end-of-well activities . 
- Poor communication between operator and subcontractors deprived otherwise capable personnel of information necessary to recognize and address risks . 
- There were muddled lines of authority within BP and between BP and its contractors .
