Thu May 27 , 2010 12:32 pm EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A team of government and independent experts on Thursday released its `` overall best initial estimate '' of the oil flowing from BP Plc 's blown-out Gulf of Mexico well . 
The Flow Rate Technical Group 's estimate is a range from 12,000 barrels per day -LRB- 504,000 gallons\/1 .9 million liters -RRB- to 19,000 bpd -LRB- 798,000 gallons\/3 .02 million liters -RRB- , well above BP 's estimate of 5,000 bpd . 
The team said it used three separate techniques to arrive at the estimate . 
Those three measurements are : MASS BALANCE ESTIMATE : 12,000-19 ,000 barrels per day The mass balance team calculated the amount of oil on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , using a NASA imaging spectrometer previously used to discover water on the surface of the moon . 
The team also estimated that between 130,000 barrels and 270,000 barrels of oil were on the ocean surface on May 17 , and a similar amount had been dispersed , skimmed or evaporated . 
PLUME MODELING ESTIMATE : 12,000-25 ,000 bpd The plume modeling team used video from remotely operated vehicles at the ocean floor to observe oil and natural gas escaping from the well 's riser pipe . 
The team used advanced imaging analysis to estimate fluid velocity and flow volume . 
RISER INSERTION TUBE TOOL ESTIMATE : at least 11,000 bpd This team studied oil being collected by a siphoning device called a riser insertion tube that BP has used to collect some oil directly from one of the two leak sites . 
On May 25 , the tool logged a collection rate of 8,000 barrels per day , the team said , as measured by a meter verified by a third party . 
The team estimated that at least 10 percent of the flow was not collected by the siphon , and that additional oil was escaping from a second leak site . 
The Flow Rate Technical Group is comprised of federal scientists , independent experts , and academic experts . 
Included are members of the U.S. Geological Survey -LRB- USGS -RRB- , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Energy Department , Coast Guard , Minerals Management Service , National Institute of Standards and Technology , University of California Berkeley , University of Washington , University of Texas , Purdue University , and several other academic institutions . 
BP is not involved except to supply raw data , USGS said .
