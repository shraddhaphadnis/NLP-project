WASHINGTON | Thu Jun 17 , 2010 3:32 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc Chief Executive Tony Hayward said on Thursday the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was preventable . 
`` I believe that all accidents are preventable , '' Hayward told a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in response to a question from a lawmaker . 
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

All accidents stem from management breakdown . 
What I would like to know is whether the compensation package Hayward received included a portion of his bonus that depended on BP 's safety record . 
That would be a clear signal from the Board that establishment of a `` safety culture '' at BP was important . 
Hayward did testify that he made a lot of changes in how the company operated once he took over . 
BP has been responsible for half of the major leaks before this one . 
They did n't follow procedure , nor did they use safety precautions as those would hinder the speed and cost of drilling . 
BP also made a worst case scenario clean up promise to get the permit , which was 4 times the amount spilling now and yet can not contain it . 
Sounds like willful negligence , not safety concerns and certainly not a desire to have a safety culture .
