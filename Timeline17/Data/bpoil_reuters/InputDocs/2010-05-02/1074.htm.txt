U.S. to keep heat on BP to stop oil leak - Salazar WASHINGTON | Sun May 2 , 2010 9:05 am EDT WASHINGTON May 2 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. government will keep a `` boot on the neck '' of BP Plc , as it responds to a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threatens to become an economic and ecological catastrophe , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on Sunday . 
`` Our job basically is to keep the boot on the neck of British Petroleum to carry out the responsibilities they have both under the law and contractually to move forward and stop this spill , '' Salazar told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program . 
He said there was `` no doubt '' that a mechanism that prevents oil from blowing out of the BP well was defective , adding that 100,000 barrels or more of oil could leak per day in a worst case scenario .

The government is leaving it up to an oil company to stop this ? 
That does n't even equate to a band aid on a severed limb ! 
Good job , Salazar . 
Keep yer foot on BP 's neck . 
Now , try cleaning up the Gulf coast in that position . 
If you , or ANYONE , has a better idea , let him throw the first barrel of oil . 
This is a calamity of the highest order , and the ` masses ' , instead of streaming to help , are rushing to court with lawsuits .
