LONDON | Tue Nov 9 , 2010 3:52 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The former chief executive of oil major BP defended his decision to go sailing while one of its wells was causing the worst-ever U.S. oil spill , saying he wanted to see his son after three months fighting the leak . 
Tony Hayward , in his first interview since stepping down as BP boss , told British national broadcaster the BBC that he would probably do the same thing again , despite the fierce criticism it provoked from the White House and the Gulf of Mexico region , where the deepsea well was sited . 
`` I have to confess , at the time I was pretty angry actually . 
I had n't seen my son for three months . 
I was on the boat for six hours ... I 'm not certain I 'd do anything different , '' he said . 
Hayward had spent most of the previous three months in the United States trying to stem the spill , during which his series of gaffes fanned public anger toward what had been , before the disaster , Europe 's biggest oil company by market value . 
The excursion involved a boat race near the Isle of Wight , which Hayward attended after he was called back to the UK by BP 's chairman , who felt the company needed to put a new face on the response effort . 
The oil spill followed an explosion on a drilling rig in April that killed 11 workers .
