HOUSTON | Tue May 25 , 2010 2:22 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Insurer Lloyd 's of London has asked a U.S. court to block a claim filed by oil major BP seeking damages against driller Transocean , which drilled the well which is currently gushing crude into the Gulf of Mexico . 
Lloyds underwriting syndicates and other insurers who provided $ 700 million of cover to Transocean lodged a case with a federal court in Houston , arguing that the policies provided to Transocean preclude claims related to environmental damage caused by leaks from the well . 
According to court documents , the insurers argue that Transocean 's contract with BP only makes it liable for environmental damage caused by any spills from its rig , which exploded and sank , causing the pipe running from the rig to the well to snap . 
The well is leaking oil . 
BP said it had lodged a claim against the insurers but declined to comment further . 
No one was available for comment at Transocean . 
Even if BP was awarded the full $ 700 million of cover the insurers provided to Swiss-based Transocean , it would be only a small fraction of the total bill for the cleanup operation and compensating people who suffered losses due to the spill . 
Analysts at UBS put the likely cost of this at $ 12 billion , in a report issued on Tuesday .
