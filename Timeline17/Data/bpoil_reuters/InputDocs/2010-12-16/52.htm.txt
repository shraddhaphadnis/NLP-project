LONDON | Thu Dec 16 , 2010 3:40 pm EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil major BP was the biggest faller on Britain 's blue-chip board on Thursday , as investors fretted that a U.S. government lawsuit might mean the cost of its oil spill will be far higher than predicted . 
Legal experts have said BP 's $ 40 billion estimate for the total cost of the oil spill -- hitherto largely accepted by financial analysts -- could double if the U.S. government managed to convince a court that BP had been grossly negligent . 
BP and analysts had dismissed this possibility so far , but the harshly worded lawsuit filed on Wednesday by the Obama Administration spooked investors who in recent months have been betting on a BP recovery and a return to paying dividends . 
`` Clearly it is a negative development . 
It creates some fears concerning the ultimate decision on gross negligence or not , '' said Societe Generale analyst Irene Himona . 
`` There is ongoing legal uncertainty , '' Himona added . 
BP 's London listed shares closed down 1.4 percent at 470 pence , underperforming a 0.1 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . 
BP 's New York-listed ADRs added to losses on Wednesday , trading down 0.2 percent at 1836 GMT . 
In recent months , BP 's shares had risen over 60 percent since hitting a low below 300 pence , on hopes the worst was behind the company . 
The stock was up 10 percent in December alone as analysts and investors speculated that BP 's oil spill provision could significantly overstate its liabilities , a hope that was dented by the lawsuit . 
`` This is a reminder of what people should have already have known , and I suppose it makes people a little nervous , '' said one top 10 investor .
