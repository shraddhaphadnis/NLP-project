How can Africa help Haiti ? 
Senegal 's President Abdoulaye Wade has called Haitians sons and daughters of Africa . 
Should the continent be doing more to help victims of the Haiti earthquake ? 
Senegal itself has offered free land and repatriation to people affected by the disaster . 
Rwanda and Liberia have pledged $ 100,000 and $ 50,000 respectively while South Africa has sent doctors and search and rescue teams . 
What are you doing to help those in Haiti , perhaps through your community or church ? 
Do you have friends or family in Haiti ? 
Do you think Africa 's response is adequate ? 
What lessons can Africa learn from the response to the Haiti disaster ?

Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 18:16 GMT 18:16 UK Good\/Sincere comments so far . 
1st , Haitians are Black People whose ancestors were removed from Africa by force . 
If Haiti was on the continent like Rwanda , Somalia , Ethiopia , Sudan , Liberia , etc. , the concerns about Africa 's role would be mute . 
Haiti has stood up for Africa . 
The best help Africa can logistically give now -LRB- since Haitians ca n't simply walk over -RRB- is by putting pressure on UN , EU , etc. and keeping Haiti visible internationally . 
Also establish long-term exchanges,business-ties , etc. . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 17:55 GMT 17:55 UK With regard to president Wade 's call for repatriation , where exactly does he intend to take these people to when Senegal can not even provide for its own people . 
I will advice he come up with a better plan or better still leave decision making to the west . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 17:47 GMT 17:47 UK It is interesting to know that some African countries are offering help to Haiti from the little they have . 
In reality , africa no no better than Haiti . 
If a 7.0 mag EQ can cripple Haiti what will it do to Africa ? 
considering the fact that help will not get to Africa as fast as it got to Haiti . 
It is time for African leaders to stop dumping Africa 's money in their pot bellies and start buildind infrastructure that will stand cases of such disaster . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 17:08 GMT 17:08 UK Why should it be Africa 's responsibility - Haitians are sons and daughters of Africa yes , but if anything it is the responsibility of those who took them there that should take huge responsibility for their welfare ! 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 17:08 GMT 17:08 UK Giving land is a good thing ; however , is that to admit that there are n't people in need of land in Senegal ? 
I wo n't water down that noble act any longer , because as an African , I must not be so ignorant to realize that UK and other nations already have help to other countries featured in their budgets . 
But to be reeeeally honest , I think after Haiti , it should be Africa next . 
But this time we do n't want petty help , but investment so that in the future we can be able to match the west in helping . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 17:06 GMT 17:06 UK I would wish I coulld offer trauma counselling to Haitiams who suffered loss in the disaater . 
The difficulty is , the loss of the Haitians is attracting many who see chances for employmeny . 
Sad , but true !! Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 16:55 GMT 16:55 UK Africa already got her own problems such as hunger , war , etc. but on the other hand , Africa has natural resources . 
Africa could therefore be of great help to Hati by offering a land for the relocation of that country which will bring about exchange of ideas . 
war and hunger are preferable to a 7.0 earthquake . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 16:45 GMT 16:45 UK surely places like Asia , north America and Europe are better powered to help - that is if they can look past their own greed to help those suffering . 
The EU and the US were among the first to offer aide , the very first to offer aide was Israel , believe it or not . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 16:36 GMT 16:36 UK Is it possible for a man stricken with a terrible choking cough to revive another who 's just lost consciousness ? 
How can Africa , a continent in perpetual hibernation , help Haiti when the continent is barely able to stand on its own feet -LRB- cackles -RRB- ... Haiti has got all the modest help it needs , what more , if any , can a comatose Africa offer ? 
Apart from South Africa , which other country in Africa has got well equipped functioning rescue teams ? 
I know Nigeria has got one , a paper rescue team ... Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 16:25 GMT 16:25 UK Africa needs to rise up and come up with money to help our counterparts in Haiti . 
This desaster is beyond imagination . 
Our African culture values the practice of sharing , even in our poverty , we can still sahre with our brothers and sisters . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 16:20 GMT 16:20 UK We really appreciate contributions from African Countries , most from those who know what it means to `` get assistance from others '' . 
Even a poor nation can still help a poorer one , mostly when it comes to a nation going through an surprising natural catastrophy . 
There are tons of things that Africa can do to assist Haiti -LRB- Volunteers : Nurses , Doctors , Engineers and Technicians , Police officers and military , . . -RRB- . 
Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 16:18 GMT 16:18 UK I think Senegal president 's offer to grant citizenship is impracticable . 
The issue of nationality in all countries is regulated by laws -LRB- including the constitutions -RRB- and I do not htink even he himself meant to ammend his laws , if any , with in such short time . 
This is not emmergency solution ; may be he meant only to divert attention from domestic trouble Added : Tuesday , 19 January , 2010 , 16:12 GMT 16:12 UK Contributing to this cause is a sign of showing that the world is one . 
As a Liberian , I am happy that my country contributed to the Hatian humanitarian process . 
Any country doing so should do so within the limit of their resources . 
I do not support those want to see silver spoon in their mouths before helping other people . 
E. Julu Swen , Monrovia , Liberia please our african leader help our brothers and sisters in haiti .
