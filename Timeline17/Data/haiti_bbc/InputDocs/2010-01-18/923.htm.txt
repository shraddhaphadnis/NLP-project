Why is Haiti such a poor country ? 
Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world , which is why it 's struggling to cope with the devastation caused by last week 's earthquake . 
Organisations like the government and police do n't work very well , lots of people there do n't have any jobs , and the country does n't make much money . 
For the last few years the United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- has been helping them . 
It has soldiers there to try to keep things peaceful , and it helps the government try to run the country . 
Haiti had a lot of problems with bad governments in the past , including lots of people being killed , and leaders being overthrown .
