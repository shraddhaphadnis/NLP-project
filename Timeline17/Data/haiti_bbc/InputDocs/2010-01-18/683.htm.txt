Quake survivors have little more than blankets and pillows There is a sign hanging over the road with a blue arrow pointing to the left of it . 
`` Help needed , '' it says . 
Further along , a group of men are hanging a fresh white banner between two telegraph poles - `` St Patrick 's Refugee Camp '' . 
Nearby , and through the wire fence , there 's a partially-destroyed school . 
You see the displaced and dispossessed , row upon row of them with plots neatly divided by lines of string tied to trees . 
Most have some blankets , some a few pillows . 
Here and there , the odd chair . 
But all have little , or worse - some say - nothing . 
Tens of thousands are crammed into the makeshift camps . 
Along dusty streets , you see them queuing for water . 
Fresh water is in short supply . 
People are still struggling to get the food and water The number of dead that remain under the rubble is also a worry . 
Disease could begin to spread . 
Prices are rising in Port-au-Prince for food and fuel . 
Some fear the desperation could provoke violence . 
Haiti 's humanitarian crisis is growing . 
People here are making the best of the harsh conditions . 
They are hugely resourceful . 
A main concern , however , is that without enough food aid and water , malnutrition will make them more susceptible to disease . 
If the weather changes and it starts to rain , that will also make things far worse than they are even now . 
And in the long term - they say here - that without a government and without jobs , they can never rebuild . 
It will take more than a few weeks of fund-raising to bring Haiti back from the dead .
