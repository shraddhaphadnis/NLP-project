French rescuers are among teams from many nations in Haiti The EU has pledged more than 400m euros -LRB- # 354m -RRB- in emergency aid for Haiti , as rescuers battle to help survivors of last week 's devastating earthquake . 
The European Commission - the EU 's executive arm - will provide 137m euros for short-term needs and at least 200m euros for the medium and longer term . 
The EU member states will provide an additional 92m euros , officials said after emergency talks in Brussels . 
Rescuers from EU nations are already working in devastated Port-au-Prince . 
The Commission said the immediate priority had been to dispatch `` urban search and rescue teams '' , including military and civil engineering teams . 
The EU may be most effective at coordinating medium and long-term development `` The current focus is to provide emergency health , water and sanitation , medical facilities , shelter , logistics , telecommunications and food . '' 
EU ministers said the work required `` adequate security on the ground to ensure safe and unhindered access of aid deliveries '' . 
The leading US general in Haiti , Lt Gen Ken Keen , says it is a `` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people may have died in last Tuesday 's earthquake . 
Relief efforts are being slowed by bottlenecks , and many thousands of survivors are fending for themselves in the ruined capital Port-au-Prince and stricken areas around it . 
The UN has launched an appeal for # 346m intended to help three million people for six months , most of whom are thought to need emergency relief . 
The British government is to triple its aid to Haiti to # 20m .
