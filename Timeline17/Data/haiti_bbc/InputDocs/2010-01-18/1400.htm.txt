Aid is slowly starting to arrive in Haiti The Democratic Republic of Congo has announced it is sending $ 2.5 m -LRB- # 1.5 m -RRB- in emergency aid to Haiti , to help it cope with last week 's earthquake . 
Some Congolese have criticised the offer . 
After years of conflict , which is still raging in the east , millions of people live in poverty . 
The country depends on foreign aid and civil servants frequently go unpaid . 
But Information Minister Lambert Mende told the BBC that DR Congo would contribute within its means . 
It 's a contradiction to see a country which is facing serious financial problems giving away $ 2.5 m `` Congo is n't bankrupt , our own problems should n't prevent us from helping a brother country , '' he said . 
But political scientist Ntanda Nkere from the University of Kinshasa told the BBC : `` It 's a contradiction to see a country which is facing serious financial problems giving away $ 2.5 m but at the same time , it 's a purely diplomatic reaction , the Congolese government wants to appear like any other government . '' 
On Sunday , Senegal 's President Abdoulaye Wade said he was offering free land to any Haitians who wanted to `` return '' to Africa . 
Most of Haiti 's population are descended from slaves . 
`` The president is offering voluntary repatriation to any Haitian that wants to return to their origin , '' said Mr Wade 's spokesman , Mamadou Bemba Ndiaye . 
Responding to the Senegalese offer , Mr Mende said the government would certainly not reject any Haitians if they wanted to move to DR Congo . 
The earthquake killed tens of thousands in Haiti , with many bodies still stuck in the remains of buildings . 
Aid is slowly arriving but aid workers are struggling to distribute it to all those who need it .
