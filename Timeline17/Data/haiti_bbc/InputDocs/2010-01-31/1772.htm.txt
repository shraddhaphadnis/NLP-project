Boy raises thousands for Haiti A seven-year-old boy has raised more than # 190,000 for victims of the Haiti earthquake by riding his bike around his local park . 
Charlie , who is from London , was so concerned about the kids suffering in the quake that he decided to do something about it . 
He rode five miles on Sunday to raise money for the Unicef children 's appeal . 
Charlie was aiming to make # 500 in sponsorship , but raised thousands after people saw his sponsorship page online . 
Charlie was sponsored from as far away as Hong Kong and New Zealand , after people read his appeal on the JustGiving website . 
On his JustGiving page , Charlie said : `` I want to do a sponsored bike ride for Haiti because there was a big earthquake and loads of people have lost their lives . 
`` I want to make some money to buy food , water and tents for everyone in Haiti . ''
