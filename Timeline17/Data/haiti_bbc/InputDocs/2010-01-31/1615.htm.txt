Many Haitian children became orphans after the earthquake Haitian police have arrested 10 US nationals on suspicion of trying to illegally take 33 children abroad . 
They say the Americans were held on the border with the Dominican Republic . 
The group from Idaho-based charity New Life Children 's Refuge told the BBC they wanted to take quake orphans to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic . 
But Haitian police said the Americans had no papers authorising them to take children out of the country . 
They have not yet been charged . 
Haiti imposed new controls on adoptions to prevent child trafficking after the 12 January earthquake that killed up to 200,000 people . 
The Americans are being held at a police station next to the airport in Haiti 's capital Port-au-Prince . 
They told the BBC that their arrest was a mistake and that they were going to take a group of earthquake orphans to an orphanage set up across the border . 
They said they thought they had had a permission to travel to the Dominican Republic . 
`` This is an abduction , not an adoption , '' Haitian Social Affairs Minister Yves Christallin was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency . 
`` What is important for us in Haiti is that a child needs to have an authorisation from this ministry to leave the country , '' Mr Christallin said . 
He added that the children involved were aged two months to 12 years . 
The earthquake destroyed a number of Haitian orphanages and crippled relevant government agencies . 
Local officials have expressed fears that child traffickers will take advantage of the situation to smuggle children abroad .
