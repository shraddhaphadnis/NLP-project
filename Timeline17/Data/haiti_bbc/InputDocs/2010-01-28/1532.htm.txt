There are hundreds of earthquakes around the world each year but only a few cause serious damage . 
The figures above seek to measure an earthquake in terms of the energy it releases . 
The scale used to measure earthquakes is unusual . 
For example , the difference in strength between an earthquake of magnitude five and a magnitude six earthquake is much more dramatic than a rise of just one unit would suggest . 
In fact a magnitude six earthquake possesses 32 times more energy than a magnitude five quake , as seismologists use a logarithmic scale to record these natural disasters . 
That means that a gap of two steps , from five to seven , represent an earthquake nearly 1,000 times stronger . 
Those quakes likely to cause the most destruction measure 7.0 and above . 
The 2004 earthquake which triggered the Asian tsunami was the third biggest quake since 1900 . 
There are an estimated 20 major quakes in the world every year according to the US Geological Survey . 
The Haiti quake measured 7.0 and because the epicentre was so close to the ill prepared capital , Port-au-Prince , the damage was severe , and over 200,000 people died as a result . 
The death toll in Haiti is in stark contrast to the magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck Chile in February 2010 where less than 1,000 people died . 
Chile has a long history of strong earthquakes . 
The largest recorded earthquake took place there in 1960 . 
It measured 9.5 and was also followed by tsunamis . 
About 1,655 people were killed - it 's thought the casualties were comparatively light because there were a number of warning shocks which sent people running out of their homes before the main quake .
