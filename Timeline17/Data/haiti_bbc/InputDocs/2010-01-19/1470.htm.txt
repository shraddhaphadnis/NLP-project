`` The type of things that the team that are arriving are going to be doing is coordinating with other organizations ; the UN , other British agencies and finding out what they 're doing . 
`` We 're making sure we 're not replicating or duplicating our efforts , making sure we cover as much of Haiti as possible . 
`` They are saying this is catastrophic . 
They are talking about this in apocalyptic terms . 
They 've never seen anything as bad as this . ''

`` It 's really a case of getting there , getting on the ground and rolling your sleeves up and doing whatever it takes , '' he said . 
`` So you work 20 hour days and there 's not much sleep . 
`` You just get your sleeves rolled up and do it because you have to . 
That 's the nature of the work . ''
