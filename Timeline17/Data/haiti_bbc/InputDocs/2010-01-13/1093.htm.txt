They said the head of the mission was inside the building and remains unaccounted for , but the earthquake struck around 5 o'clock in the afternoon , so it 's not clear how many others were still present . 
UN troops have surrounded the ruins and are trying to rescue those trapped in the rubble ; other United Nations buildings have also been damaged , but details are scarce because of disrupted communications . 
The peacekeeping force numbers around 11,000 people , including civilian personnel ; it 's located in different parts of the country , and was deployed in 2004 to bring order following an armed insurrection against then president Jean Bertrand Aristide . 
The blow to the UN 's services on the ground may slow relief and rescue efforts for the Haitian people , but its humanitarian department is sending emergency response teams and releasing emergency funds . 
The Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has said he 's shocked at the scale of the devastation and has made initial contacts to encourage a coordinated international response .
