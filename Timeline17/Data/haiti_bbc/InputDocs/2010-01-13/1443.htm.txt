ShelterBox was in Haiti in 2008 after hurricanes left thousands homeless A Cornwall-based disaster relief charity is sending help to Haiti after a massive earthquake struck the island . 
Shelterbox , which was set up 10 years ago by Helston-Lizard Rotarian Tom Henderson , provides survival and shelter equipment in disaster zones . 
It is mobilising response team members from the UK and the USA to assess aid requirements for Haiti that was hit by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake on Tuesday . 
Thousands in the Caribbean nation are feared dead after the quake . 
Lasse Petersen , ShelterBox General Manager , said : ` We 're doing everything we can to ensure immediate aid reaches the people of Haiti . 
`` The process of getting our team on the ground is well under way . 
`` We were in Haiti 18 months ago , delivering aid after a series of hurricanes left thousands homeless . 
`` We 'll now be working closely with our contacts on the ground in the country to make sure we get aid to the people who need it most during the current crisis . '' 
Since its inception at the end of 1999 , the charity has responded to more than 80 disasters in more than 50 countries , through raising # 25m in donations . 
Each shelterbox , costing # 490 , is uniquely numbered so they can be tracked by donors .
