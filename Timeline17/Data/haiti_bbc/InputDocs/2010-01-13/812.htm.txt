A powerful earthquake has hit the Caribbean island of Haiti . 
Thousands , of people are feared dead . 
So why has this quake been so destructive ? 
A quake of this power would cause lots of damage wherever it hit , but Haiti was especially vulnerable . 
Haiti is the poorest country in the western half of the world , meaning it has n't been able to prepare for big earthquakes . 
Rich countries in areas where quakes happen can afford to make buildings which can handle quakes better . 
But in Haiti , there are lots of badly built structures , which fell over easily . 
The epicentre of the quake , which is where it was strongest , was just 10 miles from the capital , Port-au-Prince . 
On top of that , the epicentre was five miles underground . 
That is quite shallow for a quake , and the closer to the surface the epicentre is , the more shaking it causes at ground level . 
After large quakes , there are often smaller quakes called aftershocks . 
The Haiti quake reached 7.0 on the Richter scale , which measures the strength of tremors . 
Following that , there were more than 10 aftershocks measuring more than 5.0 on the Richeter scale , each causing more damage . 
Haiti is regularly hit by hurricanes , which means people there have experience in dealing with large natural disasters . 
Aid is being sent in to the area , and several countries have offered money to help Haiti .
