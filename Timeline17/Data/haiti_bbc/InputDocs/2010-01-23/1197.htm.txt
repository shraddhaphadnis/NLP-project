Firefighters fly home from Haiti Kent firefighter Malcolm Cowie feared for his life when an aftershock struck Firefighters from Kent have returned with dramatic stories from Haiti where they have been helping rescue victims of the earthquake . 
Teams , who have been away for up to eight days , described how bodies lined the streets of Port au Prince . 
One firefighter said he feared for his life as aftershocks rocked a collapsed building while he was inside searching for survivors . 
The teams , many based in Maidstone , arrived at Gatwick Airport earlier . 
Firefighter John Mazzey said : `` We started searching building by building but it soon became clear that the best leads were by local knowledge . 
`` Speaking to the people who came up to us who said they could still hear talking , they could still hear scratching or knocking , so we leapfrogged from building to building following those leads . '' 
Jim Chaston and Malcolm Cowie were searching one building when an aftershock struck . 
Mr Cowie said : `` We were under an awful lot of concrete and for that moment in time we thought ` this is our lot ' . '' 
Mr Chaston said when the survivor was eventually pulled out `` it was amazing '' . 
He said : `` There was quite a large bunch of locals that had gathered by the end of it and to see the old man who was more worried about the medics undoing his trousers to check him over than where he had been for the past four days . ''
