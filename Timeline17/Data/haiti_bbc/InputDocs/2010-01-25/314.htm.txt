Shelterbox tents replace Haiti hospital wards A young amputee rests in a Shelterbox tent in Port au Prince Tents from Cornish aid charity Shelterbox are being used as makeshift hospital wards in earthquake-hit Haiti . 
About 700 tents have arrived in the Caribbean island which was devastated by a huge quake on 12 January . 
Tents have been distributed at Bernard Mews hospital in Freres , a suburb of Port au Prince and at a second hospital in the capital . 
Each ShelterBox contains a 10-person tent , blankets , water purification and cooking equipment , tools and a stove . 
The first batch of tents arrived in Haiti on Saturday evening and were put up at the two hospitals where patients have been surviving outdoors . 
Shelterbox founder Tom Henderson said : `` Within hours our tents were full of amputees . 
`` As they came out of the operating theater the beds were rolled into our tents which were used as mini wards . '' 
On Friday , ShelterBox is chartering a 747 aircraft with 1,800 boxes to fly from Stansted Airport to the Dominican Republic where they will be taken overland to neighbouring Haiti .
