A seven-year-old west London boy has now raised more than # 145,000 for Haiti quake victims in a sponsored bike ride . 
Charlie Simpson , from Fulham , had hoped to raise # 500 by cycling five miles -LRB- 8km -RRB- around South Park on Sunday for Unicef 's relief efforts in Haiti . 
A day after his five-mile ride Charlie said : `` My legs are a bit sore after the ride , but it was really fun . '' 
His effort led to donations pouring in on the JustGiving website from as far away as New Zealand and Hong Kong . 
Charlie , who went back to school earlier , is still unaware of how much he has raised but Unicef said he will be told when he visits its office later . 
Charlie 's father Dan Simpson said : `` We can not believe the incredible response from the UK public . 
Thanks for all the messages of support , they really mean a lot `` Charlie is so grateful to people for sponsoring him and he is delighted his bike ride has meant Unicef can help so many children in Haiti . 
`` Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to donate and thanks for all the messages of support , they really mean a lot . '' 
His family said the ride had begun as a `` little cycle round the park with his dad '' . 
Michael Newsome , director of fundraising at Unicef UK , said : `` Everyone at Unicef is absolutely staggered at how much Charlie Simpson has raised . 
`` His donations will mean we can help thousands of vulnerable children in Haiti . '' 
He added : `` Charlie spoke out about Haiti and the UK has listened - we are so proud of him . 
`` We would now encourage other people inspired by Charlie to try fundraising themselves to help Unicef 's vital work with children in Haiti . '' 
Before the bike ride , Charlie wrote on his JustGiving page : `` I want to do a sponsored bike ride for Haiti because there was a big earthquake and loads of people have lost their lives . 
`` I want to make some money to buy food , water and tents for everyone in Haiti . '' 
The final amount raised by Charlie will be increased by a Gift Aid supplement .
