Simon Cowell wants as many artists as possible to take part in the single Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : `` Simon Cowell can make a huge amount of money to help the people of Haiti . ''

Chris has visited Haiti before : `` It 's a country of extreme poverty and brutal living conditions , '' he said . 
`` The earthquake that has struck Haiti will have turned the city into an unimaginable hell . ''
