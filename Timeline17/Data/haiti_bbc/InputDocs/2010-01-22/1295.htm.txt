Haiti starts to move quake victims Quake survivors moved out of cities Haiti has started moving its earthquake survivors to camps outside the capital , where they should be safer . 
People are living in bad conditions in Port-au-Prince , and they are struggling every day to get food and clean water . 
It 's hoped the move will help stop the spread of disease , as there 's nowhere for people to wash or go to the toilet . 
Around 400,000 people will be moved to tent villages outside the capital as soon as possible . 
The camps are n't built yet but they will be soon . 
There are fears that lots of people could start getting ill if something is n't done . 
Some people are already being moved outside the capital , to a place called Croix Des Bouquets , where the camps are being built . 
About 1.5 million people were left homeless after the earthquake , and up to 200,000 people have died . 
Around half a million people are already living in temporary camps in Port-au-Prince , but conditions there are not good . 
Police are also working hard because people have started to steal food and aid from each other . 
But once the new camps are built , it 's hoped this will stop .
