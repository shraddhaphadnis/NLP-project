On the ground in Haiti with survivors as they desperately plead for help `` People are sleeping everywhere because they are too afraid to stay inside their houses . '' 
That is the news from relief worker Sarah Dellor , who is stationed in Haiti providing aid after the earthquake which hit on 12 January . 
`` The critical needs are food , water and fuel . 
People are sleeping out in the open , '' she told BBC Radio Berkshire . 
Sarah is stationed in the capital Port-au-Prince with the charity Tearfund . 
`` Tents still need to come through . 
In a nearby church garden , 125 orphans from a orphanage nearby are staying on the grass , in cots still out in the open , although tents did arrive yesterday . '' 
Sarah is the East and Central Africa disaster management officer for Tearfund - a relief and development charity - which sent a team out to Haiti on 17 January . 
The Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 people were killed and three million people affected by the earthquake , which hit 7.0 on the Richter Scale . 
Sarah was in Haiti on 20 January when an aftershock hit , measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale . 
`` It was at 6am in the morning so most people were still asleep , '' Sarah said . 
`` We were sleeping in tents and it was pretty scary because it was our first night here . 
`` To get woken up , when you 're still asleep , it takes a couple of seconds to register what is happening . 
`` There was an awful lot of noise because people were screaming - we just tried to get out of our tents quick enough to be safe . 
`` Fortunately where we are staying , there are not many buildings around . 
We were fairly safe . 
Many people live in poorly constructed houses on hills in Haiti `` It was quite quick , about 10 seconds . 
You could see the trauma of people . 
You could see the panic . 
`` Obviously people who had experienced the big earthquake last week - all the trauma comes flooding back . 
There were real moments of panic . 
`` More buildings collapsed as well and I heard of an orphanage nearby where hundreds of children died yesterday . 
`` The structures which had become unsafe in the big earthquake were so fragile , now further damage has been done . '' 
Sarah , who is from the west Berkshire village of Woolhampton , has been in earthquakes in Indonesia during the Tsunami , but said the tremors in Haiti were still scary . 
`` I immediately knew what it was so I could quickly get out . 
But it was pretty scary . 
Last night there were several small tremors . 
`` I was awake quite a lot last night anyway because there were quite a lot of gun shots , the noise of the helicopters and planes going over and just because everyone is sleeping outside there is so much noise . '' 
Sarah explained that many people in Haiti were frightened and panicked . 
`` Fear is the big thing in terms of aftershocks . 
People are too scared to go back in the houses and because the houses are unstable anyway , it 's good they are not sleeping inside , but the trauma of the earthquake is there and the panic which so immediately sets in , is horrible . '' 
The lack of basic amenities is still a big problem and aid is still very much needed . 
`` Food and water are still a big priority and fuel is hampering all operations because they are trying to get it to the people , '' Sarah said . 
The Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 have been killed `` Once we can get some fuel then that 's going to help the situation enormously . 
`` Tents are a big issue . 
It has n't rained here since the earthquake which is amazing because it normally does rain here . 
`` There are about one million to 1.5 million people sleeping outside at the moment , if it rains , the situation is just going to be another disaster because of the spread of disease . 
`` There 's so much rubbish on the streets and obviously there is no sanitation at all , so if it rains , the sanitation situation is going to deteriorate very quickly . ''
