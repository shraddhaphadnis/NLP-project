Emily Eavis , who traveled to Haiti with Oxfam in 2002 to meet coffee farmers supported by the charity , said : `` We felt it was important to do whatever we could to help as quickly as possible . 
`` I visited Haiti in 2002 and it 's the poorest place I 've ever been by a long way . 
`` It seems doubly unfair that it should be hit by such a devastating earthquake , especially after the hurricanes of the last two years . '' 
Chris Martin , who was in Haiti with Emily Eavis at the same time , added : `` I visited Haiti a few years ago . 
It 's a country of extreme poverty and brutal living conditions . 
`` Most people in Port-au-Prince live in tin shacks . 
The earthquake that has struck Haiti will have turned the city into an unimaginable hell . 
`` The people of Haiti will be desperate for help and assistance . ''
