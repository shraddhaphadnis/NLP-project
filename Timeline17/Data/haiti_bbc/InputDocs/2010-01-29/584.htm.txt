Construction slow on Haiti 's ` tented villages ' More than two weeks after the earthquake in Haiti , there are still no signs of the tented villages the government there has been promising . 
At least one million people were left homeless by the quake , which flattened most of the capital , Port-au-Prince . 
Only aid workers have so far succeeded in the construction of a '' tented village '' for 3,000 refugees . 
Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports from Haiti .
