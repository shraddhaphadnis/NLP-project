Red Cross workers load aid parcels for Haiti earthquake victims An appeal to help victims of the Haiti earthquake is breaking all records , fuelled by the power of social media . 
Type `` Haiti '' into Twitter , Facebook or Youtube and you soon encounter a message from @redcross sent at 05:38 GMT on Jan 13 . 
In less than 48 hours , the American Red Cross had received more than $ 35m in donations - including $ 8m directly from texts . 
`` This breaks all world records for a mobile giving campaign , '' says their spokeswoman , Gloria Huang . 
`` It 's been incredible . 
People have donated more to Haiti than to Hurricane Katrina or the tsunami in Asia . 
`` And Twitter has played an extremely significant part . '' 
In the race to fundraise , social network sites have given aid agencies the power to bypass TV and radio and appeal directly to the public . 
The Haitian musician Wyclef Jean , for example , has raised $ 1m for earthquake victims through his Yele Haiti foundation , after appealing for help through Twitter . 
We tweeted ... celebrities re-tweeted ... and after that , the appeal spread like wildfire In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake , he tweeted , asking for donations through his foundation . 
His 1.3 million followers answered his call - and passed on his appeal with a message : `` Spread the word '' . 
Meanwhile on Facebook , hundreds of thousands of people signed up to awareness groups , such as Earthquake Haiti , which offers a link to Oxfam 's Haiti relief fund . 
On Youtube , the video sharing site , bloggers began posting their own personal appeals , calling for donations . 
So , how was this mass mobilisation achieved ? 
After all , the American Red Cross had only a modest number of followers on Twitter when their appeal was launched . 
Their trick was to alert popular celebrities - and let their fans on Twitter do the rest . 
`` Our plan worked exactly like it was supposed to , '' says Wendy Harman , social media manager , at the American Red Cross . 
My worry was - are people just re-tweeting ? 
Or are they actually donating ? 
`` We have a ` cabinet ' of 30 celebrities , who have agreed to ask their Twitter followers to spread the word . 
`` Within three hours of the earthquake , we had our text number ready . 
And then others quickly followed . 
People like Michelle Obama , Jane Seymour and Craig Newmark -LRB- of Craigslist -RRB- got on board . 
And after that , the appeal spread like wildfire . '' 
Twitter users across the globe began using the RT -LRB- re-tweet -RRB- function to pass the message on to their friends and followers . 
Within hours , the number for the text appeal : `` 90999 '' was ranked among Twitter 's top 10 `` trending topics '' - which in turn drove more and more people to donate and spread the word . 
Wyclef Jean raised $ 1m through his Yele Hait Foundation appeal `` We hit that magical viral sweet spot , '' says Ms Harman . 
`` Everybody out there seems to know that if you text 90999 you donate $ 10 to the Haiti appeal . 
`` My worry was - are people just re-tweeting ? 
Or are they actually donating ? 
It soon became clear that they really were texting and calling . '' 
Using an online map tool , hosted by Mgive.com , she and her colleagues were able to watch as donations flooded in from every US state . 
They did not even have to re-send their appeal . 
The online community were busy spreading the word for them . 
`` People have been sceptical over the power of the RT -LRB- re-tweet -RRB- and of Twitter generally , '' says Ms Harman . 
`` For example , during the Iran election there was a viral campaign to change your avatar color to green . 
`` But this time , people seemed to be saying : ` Let 's not do anything cute - let 's just donate ' . 
`` I think we have crossed the threshold of novelty with Twitter . 
People now want to use it to get something good done . '' 
But of course , as with any appeal for charity , people 's good will can easily be exploited . 
The avalanche of tweets , emails and Facebook groups urging web users to donate carries with it an opportunity for internet fraudsters to profit . 
Any money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal Would-be donors have stumbled on some suspicious websites . 
On Facebook , a group has been founded with a pledge to donate $ 1 for every person who joins . 
The group has gathered more than 500,000 members . 
But since it has no administrators , it is not clear who , if anyone , will actually donate the promised money . 
Meanwhile , the security firm Symantec alerted web users to an email scam , soliciting donations for Haiti victims , which purports to come from the British Red Cross -LRB- BRC -RRB- . 
`` The scammers have used the correct postal address , but the BRC does not use Western Union for donations , '' said Con Mallon , a Symantec spokesman . 
`` Also , the email address supplied as a contact is not one belonging to the BRC and any money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal . '' 
This `` appeal '' email was identified as a scam by Symantec security firm The US Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning on Wednesday calling on internet users `` to apply a critical eye and do their due diligence '' before responding to online requests for aid to Haiti . 
`` Make contributions directly to known organizations rather than relying on others to make the donation on your behalf to ensure contributions are received and used for intended purposes , '' the FBI said in its advisory . 
Amid the mass of appeals for help sent round on Twitter , even some very expert Tweeters have fallen victim to rumor and misinformation . 
Jennifer Preston , social media editor of the New York Times , passed on a tweet to her followers , stating : `` American Airlines is taking doctors and nurses to #Haiti for free . 
Spread the word '' . 
However , not long afterwards , she sent her fans a follow up message . 
`` We are now hearing that it might not be true ... '' she tweeted . 
`` LESSON LEARNED : do not RT offers to help ... unless you confirm . ''
