Mr Robertson made the comments on his program The White House has dismissed as `` stupid '' comments by evangelist broadcaster Pat Robertson suggesting that quake-struck Haiti was cursed . 
Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was amazed by the remarks . 
During a broadcast on his Christian Broadcasting Network , Mr Robertson suggested the Haiti 's earthquake was divine retribution . 
He said Haiti had sworn a pact with the devil when it freed itself from French colonial rule . 
The White House said the comments were completely inappropriate . 
`` It never ceases to amaze , that in times of amazing human suffering , somebody says something that could be so utterly stupid , '' Mr Gibbs said . 
`` But it , like clockwork , happens with some regularity . '' 
Mr Robertson , an 80-year-old former presidential candidate , made the comments on Wednesday on his program , `` The 700 Club '' . 
`` They said , we will serve you if you will get us free from the French . 
And so , the devil said , okay it 's a deal , '' the televangelist said during the broadcast . 
`` Ever since , they have been cursed by one thing after the other , '' he added , comparing Haiti to its more prosperous neighbor , the Dominican Republic . 
In a statement on his network 's website , spokesman Chris Roslan said Mr Robertson never said the earthquake - which is feared to have left tens of thousands dead - was God 's wrath . 
He added : `` History , combined with the horrible state of the country , has led countless scholars and religious figures over the centuries to believe the country is cursed '' .
