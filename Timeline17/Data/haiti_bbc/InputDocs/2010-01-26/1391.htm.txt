Haiti earthquake aid Red Cross van stolen in London Red Cross workers across the world have helped deliver aid to Haiti A Red Cross van on its way to collect goods for the Haiti earthquake appeal has been stolen in south-east London . 
The van was flagged down in Nunhead at about 1130 GMT on Monday by a man who told the driver he had run over a cat . 
As he got out to check , another man got into the van and drove off towards New Cross or Brockley . 
The white Ford Transit was the only Red Cross van covering London . 
It has `` British Red Cross '' on its sides and the registration number KD06 EVY . 
The van had just been used to drop off donated goods at a Red Cross shop and was being driven to pick up more when it was stolen . 
British Red Cross fundraising director Mark Astarita said : `` This is a very sad thing to happen . 
`` Now the DEC Haiti Earthquake Appeal may miss out on hundreds of pounds which would have gone to help those people struggling to cope following the devastating earthquake in Haiti . '' 
Det Insp Simon Day said : `` This was obviously a well-planned scam , and I would advise other drivers to be vigilant . '' 
The 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed as many as 200,000 people in Haiti earlier this month and left an estimated 1.5 million people homeless .
