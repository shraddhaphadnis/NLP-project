Boy raises thousands for Haiti A seven-year-old boy is raising at least # 35,000 for victims of the Haiti earthquake with a sponsored bike ride . 
Charlie , who is from London , was so concerned about the children he saw suffering that he decided to do something about it . 
He 's going to ride five miles to raise money for the Unicef children 's appeal which is providing food , water and healthcare for kids in Haiti . 
`` I just saw it on the news , '' said Charlie , who was watching with his mum . 
His mum said : `` He was really sad , he was really upset . 
`` We had a chat about what he could do and how it affects people , and he took it into his own hands . '' 
To start with Charlie was hoping to raise # 500 for the charity , but by Sunday lunchtime that amount was to # 35,000 and still rising ! 
He said : `` I 'm going to cycle round the park around seven or eight times . 
`` I 'm going to be with my daddy and maybe one of my friends . ''
