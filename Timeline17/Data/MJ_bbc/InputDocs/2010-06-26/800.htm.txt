By Peter Bowes BBC News , Los Angeles Fans sing outside the Jackson family home It was a day for Michael Jackson 's fans to remember their idol . 
A year on from his sudden death , tributes were paid to the pop star outside the family home , the cemetery where he was laid to rest and at his star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame . 
The fans brought flowers , held candlelight vigils and left handwritten notes paying homage to the musician . 
`` I 'm sad and I miss him but it does n't feel like a year since he 's been gone , '' said Vanessa Montez , who visited the Jackson family home in Encino , California . 
`` He 's very much still alive through his music and in my heart . '' 
Kellie Sargent said : `` He was the best entertainer there ever was on the planet so that 's why we 're here all the way from Atlanta , Georgia . 
`` It 's sad in a way but it 's a celebration of his life and entertainment . '' 
Fans traveled to Los Angeles from around the world . 
`` I 'm here for Michael Jackson because I love him , '' said Valerie Giordani from the south of France . 
`` It cost me a lot of money , a lot of time , but I do n't mind because my husband and I really love him . '' 
The main focus of the Los Angeles tributes was at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park , where the singer 's golden casket was entombed last September in a neo-classical mausoleum . 
`` I always wanted a chance to show him my gratitude but now I know I never will because he 's not with us anymore , '' said Sekou Barrow , another fan . 
`` He has n't been with us for the last year , and today we 're here at the memorial park to celebrate his life . '' 
`` It 's refreshing to see that everyone is celebrating the life of Michael Jackson , not mourning the death , '' added Carlo Riley . 
`` We had him for 50 years , more than we could ever ask for . 
He produced a large amount of material for generations to enjoy so I 'm very pleased to have been alive during his lifetime . '' 
Outside Jackson 's rented home in Beverly Hills , sightseeing buses crawled along the street , at the precise minute , 12-months on , that the singer was rushed to hospital . 
A wax model of Jackson was put on display in front of Madame Tussauds on Hollywood Boulevard , close to the singer 's star on the Walk of Fame . 
The star itself was covered in floral tributes and surrounded by candles . 
Some fans left notes for Jackson . 
Tour buses drove past the house where Michael Jackson died `` We miss you Michael , '' read one . 
`` You were our angel on earth , now you an angel in Heaven , '' said another . 
Dennis Ezequeiel , dressed as Jackson , visited the star with his mother . 
`` He 's the best because he helped the people so much and that 's why I like to dress like him , '' said the 10-year old . 
`` I like the dances he did and the songs like Man in the Mirror . '' 
Some of the fans reflected on the slow pace of the legal proceeding surrounding Dr Conrad Murray , Jackson 's physician , who has pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter . 
If the case goes to trial , it is likely to be well into next year before a jury hears the evidence . 
`` I wish there were closure , '' said Kimberly Solano from Washington , New Jersey . 
`` But I understand that things take time and I just pray that the family finds peace . '' 
The tributes will continue throughout the weekend . 
Jackson family members are expected to attend a gala event , `` Forever Michael , '' at a Beverly Hills hotel on Saturday . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
