Dr Conrad Murray faces four years in prison if convicted The trial is expected to last about six weeks . 
Pastor said he wanted the `` absolute least intrusive placement '' of a TV camera in the courtroom and asked for detailed proposals from local news teams . 
He has blocked cameras from broadcasting jury selection , which will take place on the first day of the trial . 
At a preliminary hearing last month , witnesses testified that Dr Murray tried to hide the fact that he had given Jackson propofol , a powerful surgical anesthetic typically administered in a clinical setting . 
And a police detective testified that Dr Murray told him he had given Jackson propofol after administering milder drugs throughout the night to help the singer sleep . 
His lawyers say prosecutors have failed to prove their assertion that Dr Murray caused Jackson 's death . 
They argue that Jackson 's poor health contributed to his death . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
