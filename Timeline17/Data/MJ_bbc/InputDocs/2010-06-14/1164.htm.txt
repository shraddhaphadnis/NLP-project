Michael Jackson 's family were in court for the decision The doctor accused of giving Michael Jackson a lethal dose of anesthetic will be allowed to work in California as he awaits trial , a court has ruled . 
During a brief procedural hearing , a Los Angeles judge said he did not have the authority to ban Dr Conrad Murray . 
Members of the popstar 's family were inside court to hear the ruling . 
Dr Murray , 57 , denies involuntary manslaughter of Jackson , who died last June . 
A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for 23 August . 
California 's attorney general had asked the judge to suspend the cardiologist in the run-up to the trial . 
But Dr Murray 's lawyers argued that he needed to continue working to pay for his defense . 
Dr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in jail if convicted They said he had no intention of practising in California , but argued that a ban in that state would affect his working in Texas and Nevada . 
Judge Michael Pastor said the matter had already been ruled on by a previous judge , and he refused to allow the attorney general 's application . 
`` I do not have the ability to revisit a ruling by one of my colleagues , '' he said . 
The doctor is alleged to have administered a lethal dose of Propofol and other drugs , which resulted in the popstar 's death on 25 June . 
A condition of Dr Murray 's bail is that he does not administer Propofol . 
If convicted , he faces up to four years in jail . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
