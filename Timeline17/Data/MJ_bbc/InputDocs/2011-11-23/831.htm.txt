Conrad Murray prosecutors seek four-year sentence With California 's crowded prisons , any actual time in prison could be quite short Prosecutors for the state of California have asked a judge to sentence Conrad Murray to four years in prison , the maximum allowed in his case . 
His lawyers have asked that he is kept on probation , saying he is serving `` a lifetime sentence of self-punishment '' . 
Murray was convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of legendary singer Michael Jackson after a six-week trial . 
A new California law passed to combat prison overcrowding could limit Murray 's sentence . 
Adopted in October , the law sends low-risk prison inmates to county jails . 
Los Angeles County jail officials have been releasing inmates early . 
As well as seeking a four-year term , prosecutor David Walgren also said that Murray , 58 , should pay restitution to Jackson 's children . 
Murray could also lose his licence to practice medicine . 
In a sentencing memorandum delivered to Judge Michael Pastor in advance of a 29 November hearing , Mr Walgren said Murray had shown no remorse for Jackson 's death . 
Michael Jackson died on 25 June 2009 from an overdose of the powerful anesthetic propofol . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
