The doctor pleads not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter . 
Dr Thao Nguyen , an emergency room cardiologist , said Conrad Murray `` sounded desperate '' and `` looked devastated '' in June 2009 . 
She said he told her that he had no concept of time , because he did not have a watch . 
He was unable to tell hospital staff how much time had passed since Michael Jackson had stopped breathing . 
Dr Nguyen said resuscitating the singer was a `` remote hope . '' 
He was declared dead after an hour and 13 minutes . 
The authorities say the pop star died from an overdose of the powerful sedative propofol , administered at his home .
