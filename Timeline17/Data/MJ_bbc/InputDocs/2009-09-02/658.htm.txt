Jackson suffered a cardiac arrest in June Michael Jackson 's death certificate has been amended to reflect his cause of death as homicide . 
The document has been changed to specify that his death was caused by `` injection by another '' . 
Investigators had concluded that a powerful concoction of prescription drugs killed the pop star . 
The coroner 's further homicide verdict increases the chances of criminal charges being brought against Jackson 's doctors . 
Jackson died at his Los Angeles home in June , aged 50 . 
Police have interviewed his personal physician Dr Conrad Murray but he has not been named as a suspect . 
He has strenuously denied any wrongdoing . 
Jackson is expected to be buried in a private sunset ceremony in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in California . 
Only close family and friends of Jackson will be in attendance for the event . 
Meanwhile , a hoax video apparently showing the singer emerging from a coroner 's van has emerged . 
German channel RTL posted the footage on YouTube and received 880,000 hits in one day . 
Heike Schultz , spokeswoman for the network , said it had been an experiment . 
`` We wanted to show how easily users can be manipulated on the internet with hoax videos , '' she said . 
`` Therefore , we created this video of Michael Jackson being alive , even though everybody knows by now that he is dead - and the response was breathtaking . ''
