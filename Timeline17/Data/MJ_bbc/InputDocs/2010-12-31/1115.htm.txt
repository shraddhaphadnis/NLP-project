Michael Jackson died in June 2009 aged 50 Executors for the late star 's estate had requested the program - entitled Michael Jackson 's Autopsy : What Really Killed Michael Jackson - be canceled . 
John Branca and John McClain had said the show was `` in shockingly bad taste '' . 
Discovery said an forthcoming court hearing was also a factor . 
`` Given the commencement of legal proceedings beginning next week , and at the request of Michael Jackson 's estate , the scheduled broadcast of the medical documentary related to Michael Jackson 's official autopsy has been postponed indefinitely , '' Discovery Networks International said in a statement . 
Mr Branca and Mr McClain said they were pleased with the network 's decision . 
In a letter previously sent to Discovery , the pair had accused the company of being motivated by `` blind desire '' to exploit the singer 's death . 
`` Your decision to even schedule this program is in shockingly bad taste and insensitive to Michael 's family , '' the co-executors wrote . 
The program was scheduled to be aired in Europe on 13 January . 
An advertisement used to promote the show reportedly depicted a body covered by a sheet with one hand wearing the singer 's trademark sequined glove visible . 
A preliminary hearing is scheduled to begin on 4 January where it will be decided if there is sufficient evidence to try Jackson 's physician , Dr Conrad Murray , on involuntary manslaughter charges . 
Dr Murray has repeatedly denied causing Jackson 's death . 
The singer died suddenly in June of 2009 from a prescription drug overdose at age 50 , weeks before beginning a set of concerts . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
