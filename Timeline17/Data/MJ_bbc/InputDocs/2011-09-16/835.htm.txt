Michael Jackson 's brother Jermaine has explained his criticism of a forthcoming concert organised in tribute to the late star . 
Michael Forever , a show supported by Michael 's mother Katherine , is to take place in Cardiff on 8 October . 
Speaking to Newsbeat Jermaine Jackson criticised the timing of the concert which will clash with the trial of Dr Conrad Murray . 
`` It 's bad timing because it 's two weeks into the trial , '' he said . 
`` It 's good to celebrate , good to keep the legacy alive , but everything has its time . '' 
The concert is to feature performances from Christina Aguilera , JLS , Ne-Yo , Leona Lewis and Beyonce - who will perform via satellite link up . 
Last month , the organiser of the Michael Jackson tribute concert , Chris Hunt , defended the event saying that he has the `` overwhelming majority '' of the Jackson family behind him . 
He told Newsbeat : `` The notion that an event which reminds people just how fantastic Michael Jackson was , what a loss he was to the world , what a great singer , a great performer he was , should be inappropriate - it does n't compute , it does n't make sense . '' 
But Jermaine has hit back . 
He said : `` We 're all focused on getting justice for Michael , the best tribute we can do for him is getting justice and making sure we get justice as a family as to what happened . '' 
Dr Conrad Murray is accused of involuntary manslaughter . 
He denies he gave the singer an overdose of an anesthetic which killed him .
