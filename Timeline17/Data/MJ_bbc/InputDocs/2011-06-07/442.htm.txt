The UK firm that insured Michael Jackson 's comeback gigs at London 's O2 arena has asked a judge in Los Angeles to nullify the $ 17.5 m -LRB- # 10.7 m -RRB- policy . 
Insurer Lloyd 's of London is suing promoter AEG Live saying it failed to supply details including apparent `` prescription drug use and\/or addiction '' . 
AEG took out the cancellation and non-appearance policy - with cover of up to $ 17.5 m - two months before Jackson 's June 2009 death , court papers suggest . 
AEG Live was not available for comment . 
Lloyd 's said a lawyer for AEG Live submitted a claim , along with Jackson 's death certificate , within days of the singer 's death . 
It said that , when AEG Live took out the policy - in which the singer was given the alias Mark Jones - it should have given full information about his medical history . 
The insurer said a required medical examination was never carried out . 
It also claimed it had sought information from the promoter about Jackson 's personal doctor , Conrad Murray , since December 2009 . 
AEG had failed to provide that information , Lloyd 's said . 
For all these reasons , Lloyd 's said it was not obliged to pay for the cost of canceling the shows - one of the biggest debts faced by the singer 's estate following his death . 
Dr Murray , who had been treating Jackson for insomnia , has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the singer 's death . 
Prosecutors say he gave Jackson a lethal dose of a powerful anesthetic and then failed to provide proper care . 
Lawyers for Dr Murray , who will appear in court later this year , have suggested in recent months that the singer gave himself the dose of anesthetic . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
