Making the announcement on the event 's Facebook page they added that Beyonce was `` a lifelong Michael fan '' . 
She will join confirmed artists Leona Lewis , JLS , Christina Aguilera , Pixie Lott and Cee Lo Green at the event . 
The concert has been the subject of controversy since initial details were announced last month . 
Two of Michael Jackson 's brothers had criticised the planned tribute the pop superstar as `` inappropriate '' and `` ill-timed '' . 
Jermaine and Randy Jackson are unhappy that it will clash with the trial of Conrad Murray , the doctor charged in relation to their brother 's death . 
Rock band Kiss were then booked for the gig and removed once comments made by their bass player Gene Simmons about Michael Jackson were highlighted . 
He had described Jackson as a `` child molester '' during a magazine interview last year . 
Jackson was cleared of child molestation in 2005 . 
Organisers of the gig have reiterated that tickets for the concert , which takes place on 8 October , will go on sale to the general public on Wednesday at 9am .
