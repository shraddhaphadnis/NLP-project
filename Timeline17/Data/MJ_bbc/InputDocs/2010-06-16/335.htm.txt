Jackson , 48 , was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena on Tuesday , according to the Associated Press news agency . 
He was in court on Monday with his family for a hearing in the case of Dr Conrad Murray . 
The doctor is accused of giving Michael Jackson a lethal dose of anesthetic but denies involuntary manslaughter . 
Last week , Randy Jackson appeared on CNN program Newsroom and said that Dr Murray should be charged with first-degree murder . 
Randy Jackson recently succeeded in stopping an unapproved tribute show to his brother Michael in Rome , which had been scheduled for 25 June , the anniversary of his death . 
He thanked fans on Twitter for their support in his effort to get it canceled . 
Another Twitter post stated : `` I know my brother is at peace although I miss him so much . 
Now that he is gone , my job is to uphold his wishes and make sure justice is served . '' 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
