Promoters said the US group will perform at the Michael Forever tribute on 8 October . 
Other stars booked to appear are Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green . 
Michael Jackson 's eldest brother Jermaine Jackson is opposed to the concert as it clashes with the trial of Conrad Murray , who is accused of involuntary manslaughter . 
Prosecutors claim Conrad Murray caused the pop star 's death by giving him a powerful anesthetic , propofol , to help him sleep . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to the charges . 
Lawyers for the doctor say the star was drunk and unconscious just before a press conference in London to announce his comeback gigs at the O2 . 
They wanted to show the video to jurors when Dr Conrad Murray goes on trial in California this week but the judge says it is not relevant . 
A jury of seven men and five women has been selected from a panel of nearly 400 people .
