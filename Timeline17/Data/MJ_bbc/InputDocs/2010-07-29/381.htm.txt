Jackson 's personal doctor Conrad Murray , who denies involuntary manslaughter , was not one of those questioned by state investigators . 
He is accused of giving Jackson a lethal overdose of anesthetic .

Lawyer Brian Oxman , who is representing Jackson 's father in a wrongful death civil case , said he was `` very disappointed '' . 
`` The misuse of medications by Michael Jackson in the last years of his life was excessive and to fail to bring that to the public eye is ignoring reality , '' he said . 
In his civil case , Joe Jackson accuses Dr Murray of professional negligence in administering a fatal mix of sedatives to the singer . 
The Drug Enforcement Agency has also stopped investigating any other doctors who treated Jackson , a spokeswoman said .
