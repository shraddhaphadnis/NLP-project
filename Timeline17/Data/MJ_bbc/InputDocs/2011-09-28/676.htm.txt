The BBC Radio 1 presenter will partner Hollywood actor and singer Jamie Foxx in fronting the Cardiff event . 
The star said she was `` thrilled '' to be part of the show which will take place in Cardiff 's Millennium Stadium on Saturday 8 October . 
Acts including The Black Eyed Peas , Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green are all due to take to the stage . 
Speaking of the singer , Fearne Cotton said : `` I was always a massive fan of Michael Jackson himself . 
`` Without him there 's a whole generation of performers and entertainers who might never have got their break in music . 
`` His contribution was crucial and his premature death a complete tragedy . '' 
The concert was initially announced by the star 's mother Katherine . 
Fearne Cotton said : `` I am really looking forward to enjoying the privilege of meeting his mother and other members of the Jackson family . 
`` It 's going to be a wonderful night and , thanks to the stadium 's roof , it does n't even matter if it rains . '' 
The concert has been the subject of controversy in recent weeks , with some members of the Jackson family saying it has been `` mishandled '' . 
Jermaine Jackson says the time before Michael 's death was a ` nightmare ' Speaking to Newsbeat on 16 September Jermaine Jackson criticised the timing of the concert which will clash with the continuing trial of Dr Conrad Murray . 
`` It 's bad timing because it 's two weeks into the trial , '' he said . 
`` It 's good to celebrate , good to keep the legacy alive , but everything has its time . '' 
Last month the organiser of the Michael Jackson tribute concert Chris Hunt defended the event saying that he has the `` overwhelming majority '' of the Jackson family behind him . 
He told Newsbeat the event `` reminds people just how fantastic Michael Jackson was '' , and rejected the idea that the concert will be `` inappropriate '' . 
But Jermaine Jackson said : `` We 're all focused on getting justice for Michael , the best tribute we can do for him is getting justice and making sure we get justice as a family as to what happened . '' 
Prosecutors claim Conrad Murray caused the pop star 's death by giving him a powerful anesthetic , Propofol , to help him sleep . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to the charges . 
The tribute concert will raise money for three charities including the Los Angeles-based Aids Project .
