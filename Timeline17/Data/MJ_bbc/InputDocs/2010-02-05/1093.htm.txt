Dr Murray has denied he caused Michael Jackson 's death Los Angeles prosecutors will file a criminal case against Michael Jackson 's doctor on Monday in connection with the singer 's death , officials say . 
Dr Conrad Murray 's legal team says it expects him to be charged with involuntary manslaughter . 
The announcement came shortly before the doctor had planned to surrender himself at a Los Angeles courthouse . 
Details of charges will be officially released Monday , the LA district attorney 's office said . 
Involuntary manslaughter occurs when a death is the indirect result of negligence or recklessness . 
Jackson died at his Los Angeles home on 25 June aged 50 . 
His death was ruled as homicide , mainly caused by the powerful anesthetic Propofol . 
Several drugs were found in Michael Jackson 's body A cocktail of drugs - including sedatives Midazolam and Diazepam , the painkiller Lidocaine and the stimulant Ephedrine - were also detected in his body a coroner confirmed . 
Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson Propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia , according to an affidavit made public in August . 
But he has always maintained he did not prescribe nor administer anything that should have killed the singer . 
The legal wrangling comes after several days of negotiations where his lawyers have tried to arrange for Dr Murray to surrender to prosecutors , in an attempt to avoid him being handcuffed and arrested . 
`` It seems ridiculous to us that it 's been dragging on this long '' , Dr Murray 's defense team spokeswoman Miranda Sevcik was quoted as saying by AP . 
`` To us this is showmanship and we are just done '' , she added .
