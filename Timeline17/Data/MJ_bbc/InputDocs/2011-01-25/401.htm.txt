Dr Conrad Murray faces four years in prison if convicted The doctor present at Michael Jackson 's deathbed has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the singer 's fatal overdose . 
A judge ordered Dr Conrad Murray should stand trial in March over Jackson 's death aged 50 in June 2009 . 
Prosecutors say Dr Murray , who was treating Jackson for insomnia , gave him a lethal dose of a powerful anesthetic and then failed to provide proper care . 
`` I am an innocent man , '' Dr Murray said in a Los Angeles court . 
The trial is set to begin on 28 March and is expected to last six weeks . 
The judge said he would decide before then whether to allow television coverage of court proceedings . 
Dr Murray faces up to four years in prison if convicted . 
At a preliminary hearing this month , witnesses testified that Dr Conrad had sought to hide the fact he had given Jackson propofol , a powerful surgical anesthetic typically administered in a clinical setting . 
And a police detective testified that Dr Murray had said he gave the singer the drug after administering several milder drugs during the course of the night to help him sleep . 
Dr Murray 's defense team says prosecutors have not adequately proved how Dr Murray caused Jackson 's death , and argue Jackson 's poor health contributed to his death . 
`` Dr Murray is looking forward to finally telling his side of the story , '' defense attorney Ed Chernoff said outside court . 
The Los Angeles County coroner 's office has ruled the singer died from an overdose of propofol , found in his body along with a cocktail of other sedatives . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
