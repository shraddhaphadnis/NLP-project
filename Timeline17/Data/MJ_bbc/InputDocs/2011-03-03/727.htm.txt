Dr Conrad Murray faces four years in prison if convicted A US judge has delayed the involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson 's doctor , Conrad Murray , until May to allow both sides more time to prepare . 
Dr Murray told the judge he accepted the delay , so long as it was `` not strung along over a long period of time '' . 
Opening statements , due to commence on 24 March , will now begin on 9 May . 
Dr Murray denies illegally giving Jackson drugs which led to the singer 's death in June 2009 . 
Lawyers for both sides said they would be ready by the new trial date , after having more time to share information and receive reports from experts . 
Screening of prospective jurors will begin , as scheduled , on 24 March . 
Prosecutors claim Dr Murray gave Jackson a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol , which is normally administered in hospital settings . 
Dr Murray 's lawyers have argued that the singer 's poor health contributed to his death . 
The doctor faces up to four years in prison if convicted . 
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
