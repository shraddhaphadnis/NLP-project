I just wrote a piece for Time Magazine on Obama 's strategy problem in Libya . 
Here 's an excerpt : Call it the Goldilocks military plan : Not too much , not too little , not too unilateral , not too American . 
The operation against Muammar Gaddafi 's regime in Libya mirrors the moderate temperament of its architect , Barack Obama . 
But will it work in the rough realities of international politics ? 
That 's the question that will be tested in the weeks ahead as high-tech images of cruise missiles hitting their targets give way to a mess on the ground in Libya . 
President Obama has launched an operation that has two distinct qualities , one highly unusual and the other familiar . 
At its broadest , Obama 's diplomacy has tried to redefine the exercise of American power . 
It is an effort at a distinctive form of multilateralism , deeper than anything any President has tried before . 
At the same time , Obama is proposing a limited military intervention for a problem in which U.S. interests are limited . 
That 's something Presidents in the past have promised but mostly been unable to deliver as events on the ground forced them to escalate for fear of being humiliated . 
However wise his multilateral instincts , it is how Obama handles this latter problem that will determine the mission 's success and duration . 
Check out the full article over at Time and let me know what you think . 
So far both conflicting parties in Libya refuse to cede . 
Gaddafis regime wants to recapture the east of the country and the rebels want to seize Tripoli and make it the capital of their new nation . 
What happens in Libya is deja vu . 
In history we see quite a number of similar cases . 
Ho Chi Minh and Mao Tse Tung had to fight hard to achieve their goals and they are the revered founders of their countries . 
Let the rebels fight the regime and as time goes by we know them better . 
If they prevail , they win the legitimacy to build a new Libyan nation . 
Another alternative would be a time-consuming negociation with the two parties . 
March 24 , 2011 at 10:55 am | Reply Farid , you most probably have read the Koraan , and have an educated understanding of Islam . . 
I do think the media should raise the following questions to Muslim Leaders , regarding what is happening in Libya : 1 - Where is Muslim Justice ? 
Is Gadafi & his thugs carrying out Sharia Law ?? Is killing Muslims & destroying Mosques the example of Muslim leadership to set in the world . 
Is this the Nation of Islam , that we should look up to ??? 2 - Where is Muslim Brotherhood ? 
Is it just a label of a group of fanatics used to extort or blackmail the West ??? 3 - How come the West have moved to protect defensless muslims in Libya , Egypt , Tunisia etc. , and Muslims Leaders together with their so called Arab league has not moved a finger to help suffering Muslims ? 
4 - Is n't it time , for these Muslim leaders , to grow up , take responsibility , clean up their dirty wash , and stop crying to the West for aid & dole outs ?? 5 - Why has the Azhar and other supposedly scholarly institutions , not decree a ` Fatwa ' condemning Gadafi & his like to be infidels , that all Muslims should prosecute , and carry out a ` Gihad ' against him until he is brought to justice ... This is not a load the US or West should take . 
This is a load Muslim Leaders should take ... Thanks for reading . 
First off , my demographic . 
I 'm a WASP , 56 years of age , living in the US , who has been a news and political junkie since Johnson had to take the Oath of Office when Kennedy was assassinated . 
I 'm also a stringer reporter , albeit new to the business . 
Now , here is my beef . 
These are mighty trying times , both at home and abroad . 
We are being insanely co-opted into realms that we can not possible handle , nor explain , nor resolve . 
As an old guy , here are the things that I do not understand . 
Perhaps you can help me with this . 
We intervened in Bosnia , because the atrocities were so acute . 
However , we stayed away from Rwanda . 
We went , guns a blazing to Grenada , yet we were content to allow all the despots in Africa have full rein to slaughter as many as they liked . 
North Koreans have been starving to death for decades , but somehow that 's okay . 
I guess because they supposedly have a bomb that works . 
Myanmar has been hideous for a long time , but I guess that 's okay too , because they are Indonesian , and we do n't want that again . 
It 's okay that Mubarak can go . 
We never really liked him anyway , no matter how many dollars we pumped into his military . 
But , we ca n't mess with Bahrain , or the Saudi 's , nor half a dozen other places there , because it would not be in our best interests . 
We can beat our chest at Iran , but forgo any action towards Syria . 
We leave Lebanon hanging out to dry , because , well , I 'm not even certain anymore . 
But , it 's okay to spend millions of dollars spanking Libya , and to what end ? 
We do not have enough fingers to plug up the holes of so many dikes ! 
This whole thing is really getting insane . 
The other night , I watched as we shot over $ 136 million dollars worth of Tomahawk Missiles into Libya . 
I thought , Jeez , that money could have really come in handy to those of us here at home who are suffering , and looking for a place to sleep , and a warm meal , and perhaps retraining for a job which they can sustain their families with . 
I will share an acronym with you , Fareed . 
It 's called POTS , which stands for Pandemic of Terminal Stupidity . 
Feel free to use it . 
March 24 , 2011 at 1:23 pm | Reply Not all situations are equal risk for equal results . 
Albeit Clintons great regret was doing nothing in Rowanda , Bush took us on an adventure in Iraq and Afghanistan , the crimes of the Ivory Coast are off the chart . 
We ca n't fight them all and more than likely we will have little say about the futures of Bush 's wars . 
Right now there are two big issues on the table . 
In North Africa there are three nations facing the possible light of democracy . 
Tunesia , Egypt , and Lybia each have there own issues to find the path to democracy . 
If one falls off the path it can take down the other two . 
15 % of the population of Lybia is Egypsian workers for example . 
If we ` can invest a smal air war to support freedom in that 3 nation stretch its a triple homerun . 
Imagine an out of the park victory for the moderates of the world . 
That could bring true peace to the west of Isreal that is really lasting . 
The other problem is the middle east proper . 
King Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia vrs the Iatolla 's in Iran . 
Bahrain is ruled by Suni , like King Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia . 
Yemen is also ruled by Suni , but Syria is friendly to the Shiites that are friendly with Iran , supply hezbolla with weapons and so forth . 
My money is on King Abdoulla and his 500,000 man USA trained military . 
Why does this all matter to you ? 
Well in Europe they pay $ 7 to $ 8 usd pergallon for gasoline . 
We spend enmass on the 5th and 6th fleets to keep trade routes and our business partners safe in the middle East . 
If we stop supporting the King , get your wallet out and we will pay like the rest of the world for gas . 
In fact with the current speculation we will face an estimated $ 9.50 oper gallon in the USA . 
Why dont we `` Drill Baby Drill '' ? 
Ron Reagan was a really smart guy . 
His Idea was we use everyone elses oil first before we touch the massive oil reserves in the USA and the Artic . 
We can argue , fiddle , fight , and all sorts of things until the world is dry of oil before we even think to begin to drill what we can . 
He implied in policy that there will be a day , when nations fight for food , water , and of course oil . 
The nation that runs out of oil reserves will lose that war . 
While we were plaing in Iraq and Afghanistan , China made massive investments in Africa . 
Lybia sells the lions share of their light crude to China , thus the 30,000 Chinese workers in Lybia . 
Sub Saharan African is all locked up on oil by China . 
Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is starting to run out as is Mexico and a few other places we get oil . 
Estimates on those feilds are falling dramatically and the Saudi 's have failed to miss estimates for 5 quarters . 
Mexico like Venezuala nationalized the oil industry and stuck it to every oil company that did the exploration like Texico in the day and now no one trusts them to do business . 
So now it really boils down to that nut job in Iran vrs King Abdoulla . 
Remember the Saudi protesters are the Shiite group that 12 of the 199\/11 hijackers came from . 
So we are betting on this Arab Sping to grow into Iran and Syria at the same time that we want Jordan , Baharain , and I raq to hang with King Abdulla . 
Yemen will likely end up in total chaos , and get its tail kicked by either King Abdulla or the USA . 
The uprising in Yemen is Al Quieda in the Arab Pennesula demanding their own country . 
The USA currently spends 150 million a year with the `` president of Yemen '' to fight AQAP . 
They control more than half the country and bombed the USS Cole . 
I hope this explains the whole picture to you . 
March 26 , 2011 at 8:14 pm | Reply Thank you , Randy , for interesting reading . '' 
... Remember the Saudi protesters are the Shiite group that 12 of the 199\/11 hijackers came from ... '' - are the 12 of 19 shia , indeed ? 
Al Qaeda is fundamentally sunny organization , I believe , furthermore it is on the extreme end of this shia to sunny spectrum , and bin Laden has ideological differences with both Iran and Qaddafi . 
March 27 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Ohh I forgot one thing , I 'm a WASP young guy that lives in the Phillippines , work in China and Korea , but still keep an apartment in San Diego . 
I make a living on understanding the worlds economic issues . 
As a former Kansan and US soldier with a degree in economics I feel sad about the USA . 
We can solve this countries problems with common sense but we refuse to do so . 
We spend 300 billion dollars a year and 500,000 Americans are killed by smoking every single year , why is that not outlawed ? 
If you want to smoke sign a waiver that we need not spend $ 250,000 usd trying to apply palative care when you get stage IV non small cell lung cancer . 
Other wise if a cop see 's you smoking you go to jail and get fined $ 20,000 usd . 
We spend 1 trillion dollars a year on 4 single issues like that which would balance the budget as fast as the congress can write the bills . 
Secondly we need four investments in the USA and a new 18 % flat tax . 
# 1 Invade Mexico and end the drug war combined with a real fence like Isreal has and seems to be impossible to pass . 
Give Amnesty to those in country along with a $ 50,000 usd price tag per man or woman . 
They can pay $ 100 a week payments until they earn their citizenship , and pay their back taxes or get out and dont come back . 
10 years hard labor if they try to sneak back in the USA . 
Mexico is our largest customer and business is bad because of the drug wars . 
More people die each year in Mexico than get killed in Iraq or Afghanistan . 
# 2 Lead the world in High Speed Rail so a worker in Indiana can get a job in Detroit 300 miles away and get to work in 45 minutes . 
In China that high speed national rail system drpped unemployement by 4 % . 
In South Korea it dropped unemployent by 6 % . 
In South Korea I visit a factory built at a manufacturing hub 190 km south of Seoul every year . 
It takes me 30 min to get to that manufacturing area where 95,000 people work in 300 factories . 
Shuttle buses take people from the rail to factories like clock work . 
Much the same in China quarter million jobs after about 9 months training . 
Like IKES Interstate highway system that took 6 months to set up and 12 years to build . 
# 3 Complete President Obama ; s -LRB- actually the brain trust at MIT designed the new electrical grid system called `` Smart '' It starts with the meter on your house , new wiring all through , new smart transformers , and Nano Technology integrated into the new power grid . 
Currently it will be done in 2025 when its 10 years out of date . 
If we hire and train 250,000 men today it would be done in 36 months . 
Thousands of factories ca n't come to the USA cause our utilities are out dated and every new factory requires a multi million dollar invesrtment in direct power lines to the factory from the source . 
We rank 61rst of 168 countreis in our Utility techniology in use . 
The new power grid will cut lost energey amounting to 35 % of what we use in the USA more than enough to cover the oil we buy from outside the USA . 
It will cut everyones electric bill by 26 % . 
# 4 High Speed Boadband the new advanced model that is only available in 3 US cities like Chatanooga . 
A Dr can email a massive file like a ct scan over this in real time . 
That speed is available in all of Europe . 
Also let me point out when I 'm in Europe my cell phone works in Spain or Sweden and there are no zones or coverage areas . 
Were a really 8th rate gaggle in our wireless networks and half assed cell towers . 
# 5 Get rid of the IRS and its half million workers . 
Flat tax the country at 18 % for every corporation , partnership , or individual in the USA . 
We will save 490 billion a year in cost . 
-LRB- Not counting what we pay to get our taxes done -RRB- Corporations like Exxon wont be tax free and earn 10 billion net a year , or GE 5.1 billion and also pay nothing on a 24,000 page tax return thar will never be seriously looked at cause the IRS has no time . 
March 26 , 2011 at 8:56 pm | Reply Thanks for the thoughtful and insightful article . 
Too many of your colleagues shoot from the hip with their superficial criticisms and vacuous questions , which they accompany with no analysis and no answer . 
Neither you nor the President , nor any of us , will get it right all of the time , but at least there are some , like you and the President , who use their minds to reason and articulate , and disregard the bombast . 
March 24 , 2011 at 7:47 pm | Reply Your insight in the Libya situation and other world issues is always welcomed . 
I have a question however , and maybe you can answere it . 
Why does CNN and many of their commentary guests relative to Libya , refere to gadaffi as `` Colonel Gadaffi '' ? 
Is this individual actually a commisioned military colonel , or is that just an aquired `` nick name '' . 
To me , he absolutely does not deserve the true commission title of `` Colonel '' . 
Refering to and addressing this terrorist and yet to be determined `` war ciminal '' as `` Colonel '' , is to me , to very offensive . 
Unless he has a genuine claim to the commision of Colonel , I would suggest that CNN and all other media , STOP USING THE TERM `` COLONEL '' in the context of this gadaffi buffoon ! 
March 24 , 2011 at 10:32 pm | Reply Yes , he is professional military man by training and by service and he was commissioned\/raised to colonel rank by King Idris - the king whom Qaddafi and group of his fellow officers ousted back in 1969 . 
Because of his modesty for which he is well known , he did not promote himself to general , generalissimus , or whatever other title dictators usually invent for themselves , and stayed in colonel rank throughout his entire 42-year tenure . 
So there is nothing wrong with CNN calling him `` Colonel Qaddafi '' , or simply `` Colonel '' . 
March 25 , 2011 at 8:21 pm | Reply You know ... the internet is a very useful tool in learning information like the knowledge you are apparently looking for -LRB- an badly need -RRB- . 
If you would have simply took the 15 seconds to `` google '' Colonel Gadhafi ... you would have saved yourself from looking like an uneducated fool . 
Sad but True March 26 , 2011 at 11:35 am | Reply OK . 
Hopefully the `` colonel '' part is sorted out . 
Now let 's sort out the use of term `` war criminal '' and the implied `` use of air strikes against populated areas '' by Qaddafi and `` slaughter of innocent civilians '' , `` atrocities '' , etc : It is actually NOT PROVEN at this point . 
Not by Al Jazira . 
Not found on Youtube . 
Surely , Qaddafi had used tanks and multiple rocket launchers : we saw them very clearly in reports by CNN correspondent Nick Robertson . 
And , presumably , these tanks fired their guns sometimes . 
And presumably some bombs were dropped by Qaddafi airplanes . 
And presumably all these tanks were used to intimidate civilians when they entered into a city or town . 
But what about showing destruction of civilian homes We clearly so Qaddafi residence destroyed by NATO cruise missiles , and crater left in some port , but what about showing destroyed civilian homes in Benghazi or elsewhere in rebel-controlled territory . 
Can anyone on this board ... After all , tanks a routinely used to intimidate peaceful demonstrators throughout the world . 
We saw tanks in Egypt recently . 
In Bahrein , etc. . . 
March 26 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | Reply I womder @ the reactions 2 the Libyan issue . 
The leaders of d nations of d world cant just ignore despots or d guise in any manner . 
the world wil drift into anarchy . 
Hwever these are just signs of d biblical winding down prophesied . 
No doubt these cruel treacherous leaders will be consumed . 
Hang more of such will still be recorded March 25 , 2011 at 12:19 am | Reply It 's almost comical the way western leaders play to the gallery and invest huge sums in military theatrics that achieve little . 
It seems evident that it 's economic interest more that anything else that influences the west especially America . 
So Gbagbo can choose to ignore the peoples vote and continue his illegitimate rule without as much as a look in from America . 
Once oil interests show up , America 's moralistic gibberish spews forth . 
It 's not about care for the Libyans , Egyptians or Saudis , it 's the oil `` stupid '' !

Apparently CBS feels they can work easier with Moammar and feel he is a bit more `` stable '' over the long term . 
March 26 , 2011 at 11:39 am | Reply America and England are alike two brothers in a dark room trying to create light . 
First it had to be learned , then taught to others , now metasized to the world . 
It 's a growing process that requires time and learning to grow up . 
Civil rights , and the abundance of issues are still being learned so do n't expect instant perfection . 
France is the 3rd in this trio and all the harsh words come from those who are less educated and lower in the cycle of learning . 
Now in places from Germany , Japan , South Korea , and so on we have helped inspire generations of like minded individuals . 
So it 's 2011 and the troubles in Tunisia , Egypt , and Lybia are the child bearing pains of new democracies . 
Have faith that the solid middle class or moderate minded will win in the end . 
Wait and watch as our leaders risk political capital on the idea that these Arabic Speaking people can find their way onto the path of true Civil Democratic ideals . 
March 26 , 2011 at 7:18 pm | Reply Yah , you are right Ericson and I think it will be longed journey before any American and England governments can have that light ! 
As they -LRB- US - UK + UN -RRB- caused those darkness much much wider in scope more than ever ! 
March 26 , 2011 at 7:46 pm | Reply I have little faith in governments , but do believe when someone like President Obama really sticks his neck out for an idea or a group of people . 
I agree there is a bias against sub-saharan Africa and it 's probably a racial matter . 
The USA has never gone to war to defend those people . 
I predict that Ghadaffi will fall on May 1 after a pounding by our planes , and that he will cut a deal to not go to jail and keep his money and be allowed to retire somewhere like Venezuala . 
The mans a coward and he will leave all those with him now to suffer the world courts . 
May day is the likely date as it will take time to beat down his 250,000 military of which 105,000 are army March 26 , 2011 at 9:14 pm | thanks , but this vividly indicates the road map for col. Gadafi to reave power . 
the intervation of these military powers potrays that libya has no dot of democrancy , just imagine 42 years with out elections what kind of government is that . 
therefor , such kind of military attacks will curb down the problems in African politics and indeed Afrcan presidents should emulate from what is happening to col. Gadafi of libya . 
however , according to the constitution Uganda says that power blongs to people i think it should be the same thing to libya because the natives were the first people to protest before the intervation of America and other countries . 
but the interest of Amemerica is never excluded from economic outcome . 
March 27 , 2011 at 6:51 am | Reply Muslims want to kill us . 
Muslims are killing each other and have been for 1400 years ; why should we intervene ?? Libya will end up in the hands of another dictator or the Muslim Brotherhood . 
Democracy , Islam and Sharia Law do n't mix ; they are opposed to each other . 
Why spill American blood and treasure to get in the middle of a dog fight civil war with our enemies ???? Also note ; our country is broke ! 
March 27 , 2011 at 12:11 pm | Reply The UN and US policies have a big mistake mission in Libya . 
They want the Libyan people to solve their problem . 
That is they are not standing for democracy and freedom . 
How much angry carry on the rebels when they take over Gadhafi regime ? 
How many people are going die before and after dictator Gadhafi is over ? 
When Libyan people ask the world for help , they need to do fair and equal to every people in Libya . 
They must build up a new government that stands for democracy and freedom and watch them careful until a new life comes back to normal .
