A rocket slams into a home , killing a 14-year-old boy His father , mother and brother are all hurt The family has named a newborn son after the deceased teen Faraj 's 14-year-old brother , Ibrahim , was killed instantly -- washing his hands at the sink before evening prayers . 
`` I found this place was on fire , '' said Ibrahim 's uncle , Abdallah , who rushed to the house when he heard the blast . 
`` I threw water on him , then took him to the ambulance . 
But he was already dead . '' 
Three rockets hit Misrata Monday evening in quick succession -- all packed with metal balls . 
`` We were sitting at home , the whole family , '' said Ibrahim 's father , Ali . 
`` We did n't know what happened . '' 
The father received burns to his arms and legs . 
Ibrahim 's mother , Fatima , was also injured in the attack . 
`` She has got second degree burns to both legs . 
Both limbs and the face , '' said Dr. Mohammed Froka . 
`` She has first degree burns on the face . 
But her situation when she was brought here was a little bit critical . '' 
The day before the attack , the mother gave birth to a son . 
The family has named him Ibrahim , after the brother who died in the attack . 
The older Ibrahim was buried Monday night , just hours after he was killed -- the latest grave in this city 's rapidly growing cemeteries .
