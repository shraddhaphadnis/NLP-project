The regime loyalists , riding in a convoy of nine vehicles , attacked an oil pumping station in the Libyan desert on Thursday , about 300 kilometers -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- southwest of Tobruk , said Dr. Rida Benfayed , a physician who claimed he treated a rebel fighter injured in the attack . 
Tobruk is a rebel stronghold one hour west of the Egyptian border and is the site of a key oil exporting facility where the rebels shipped out their first consignment of oil earlier this month . 
Benfayed said the gunmen opened fire on a team of nine rebel military guards manning the pumping station . 
The regime loyalists set a tire on fire to burn the remains of a senior rebel guard , the doctor said .

Opposition spokesman Ahmed Bani confirmed the attack , which showed the regime 's capability to strike deep into rebel territory with ambush-style attacks . 
`` He -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- does n't want us to sell the oil , '' Bani said . 
`` This is a lesson for us . 
We will take measures to increase security along the pipelines . '' 
Bani said the pumping station sustained damage in the attack , though the extent was n't immediately clear .
