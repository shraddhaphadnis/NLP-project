The two images of an area of Zawiya , west of Tripoli , were taken February 20 and March 20 , according to the source , who provided them on condition of anonymity . 
In the first picture , a mosque can clearly be seen just south of Zawiya 's Martyrs ' Square , but in the later picture , the mosque is gone . 
The images , the source said , were released as part of the international effort to build pressure on Gadhafi and to illustrate what coalition members say are crimes against his own people . 
Pro- Gadhafi forces retook Zawiya this month after defeating rebel forces there .

CNN could not verify the authenticity of the images , nor when they were taken . 
The images were provided to CNN at a time when there is some wavering of support from within the Arab League for the coalition military effort . 
The image of a mosque that may have been destroyed by Gadhafi loyalists may provoke angst in the Arab and Muslim world . 
A CNN team that was in Zawiya both before and after government forces retook the city confirmed the mosque served as a makeshift clinic as well as a rallying point and command center for the resistance . 
The mosque was badly damaged during fighting to retake the city , the CNN team reported . 
CNN 's Tommy Evans and John King contributed to this report .
