A CNN photojournalist is caught in the gunfire outside al-Zawiya Conflicting reports emerge over control of the town The group is eventually forced to return to Tunisia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- About an hour and a half into his trip from the Tunisian border to Tripoli on Saturday , CNN photojournalist Craig Johnston sensed something was about to change . 
`` The two government drivers -- they would n't say much to us , '' said Johnston , who was in a bus ferrying fellow journalists from Sky News and Reuters from Djerba to the Libyan capital . 
`` It was a little bit tense . '' 
Johnston said he began to notice armed men massing along the road , and large amounts of civilian traffic traveling in the opposite direction . 
`` I could sense the tension was getting worse , '' he said . 
Libyan rebels advance on Zawiya Ten minutes later , the bus drove directly into a firefight outside the coastal city of al-Zawiya . 
Rebels said Saturday that they had entered the key coastal city 33 miles west of Tripoli , with some claiming they are now in control of up to 85 % of it . 
The government strongly denied those claims . 
The drivers of the bus tried to flee the fighting as soldiers ran down the road , yelling , `` Go , go , go ! '' 
But they were hemmed in by civilian traffic . 
Eventually , after a series of turns amid the gunfire , the bus drivers maneuvered away from the danger . 
The situation lasted about 20 minutes . 
Once safely away from the fighting , they stopped to regroup , with one of the drivers going to pray at a mosque . 
As they left the scene , black smoke rose from points along the road . 
It was unclear whether it was the result of NATO airstrikes or continued fighting in the area . 
The group was back in Djerba on Saturday night after being told to leave Libya .
