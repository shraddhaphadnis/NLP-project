February 21 , 2011 | By Tom Watkins , CNN During his 42 years in power , Gadhafi has limited the formation of political and other institutions . 
Whether Moammar Gadhafi stays or goes , the turmoil-wracked country is likely to be in for more of a rough time , two Libya experts told CNN Monday . 
`` Whichever way this goes , I think there 's going to be a good amount of chaos , '' said Diederik Vandewalle , associate professor of government at Dartmouth College . 
During his 42 years in power , Gadhafi has limited the formation of political and other institutions , Vandewalle said . 
`` All civil society organizations have been eviscerated by the regime , '' he said . 
In a telephone interview Monday night , he predicted more bloodshed if Gadhafi steps aside . 
`` We could see some tribal uprisings '' as competing groups seek a share of Libya 's oil wealth , he said , describing the likely scenario as `` not very pretty . '' 
But , he added , oil exports will likely continue after `` some '' interruption . 
`` It would be in the interest of all parties that oil keep flowing , '' he said , dismissing as unlikely any apocalyptic scenario in which Libya would descend into civil war . 
The current uncertainty will likely be decided in the next few days , he predicted . 
`` It seems to me that we 're in an endgame here , '' he said . 
`` The big question is how much bloodshed we 're going to see . '' 
He called the violence against unarmed civilians `` extraordinary , but not surprising from a regime that 's truly entrenched . '' 
There are few candidates in the wings to replace Gadhafi -- `` no younger leadership able to assume that mantle of leadership , '' he said . 
But Gadhafi 's imminent departure is not a foregone conclusion , he added , putting the odds at `` 80 % go , 20 % stay . '' 
Ronald Bruce St John , who has written seven books on Libya , said Gadhafi 's reign appears to be drawing quickly to a close . 
`` He 's losing support by the hour from critical people in his regime , '' he said . 
But St John said it was unlikely that the next leader would emerge from the military , since Gadhafi has long sought to keep the institution at arm 's length . 
`` Though he was an army officer when he came to power and was supported by the military and all the original members of the Revolutionary Command Council were from the military , he has , from the beginning , evidenced a great distrust for the military , '' St John said . 
`` He recognized it as the most likely power to overthrow him . '' 
As a result , Gadhafi has routinely rotated commanders `` so no one established a base of support . ''
