Syria crisis : Middle East pundits eye end game Syrian Defense Minister Daoud Rajiha -LRB- R -RRB- , one of the ministers killed in the blast , was part of President Assad 's -LRB- L -RRB- inner circle Press commentators across the Middle East have been reading the runes after a bomb attack killed three senior regime figures . 
Twenty-four hours on , with reports about the attack still leading pan-Arab TV bulletins , many pundits see signs that an end game is approaching . 
Leading pan-Arab titles see the attack as signalling the beginning of the end for President Assad . 
Overthrowing the regime is the `` only goal '' , says UK-based al-Hayat in its editorial headlined `` Imminent end '' . 
`` This is what the battle in Damascus means , and what yesterday 's explosion means . '' 
`` Silent joy and a fear of the unknown loom in Damascus , '' says pan-Arab daily al-Sharq al-Awsat . 
The regime `` may not make it until the end of Ramadan . 
Who knows , it may not survive tonight ! '' 
President Assad has been dealt a `` death blow '' , says another al-Sharq al-Awsat commentary . 
`` The tyrant has become like a giant with his hands cut off ... -LRB- the attack -RRB- will make him follow the same path as -LRB- former Libyan leader -RRB- Gaddafi , who lived his final days alone and was killed by one of his aides . '' 
But some pundits warn that the regime will not go down without a fight , with more bloodshed likely . 
`` It may act like a wounded tiger in the coming days and strike in every direction , '' says leading pundit Abd-al-Bari Atwan in London-based al-Quds al-Arabi . 
`` It is receiving blow after blow -LRB- and -RRB- may resort to the Samson Option and kill thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of innocent people . '' 
The predicted fall of the regime is a refrain in Arab national newspapers . 
`` This attack is full of significance and signs , '' says Qatar 's pro-government al-Watan . 
`` Foremost among them is the penetration of an agency that is not supposed to be penetrated ... It is a sign that the capital 's fall to revolutionaries is very close . '' 
`` We are about to witness the end of a coward , '' says Jordan 's pro-government al-Dustur , although another commentator in the paper warns `` there are hidden cards the regime is keeping '' . 
The attack leaves Syrian government forces at a crossroads , says Lebanon 's al-Mustaqbal . 
They can `` either destroy the capital of the Umayyad -LRB- dynasty -RRB- , or decide to overthrow the criminal mind which dragged the country to this abyss '' . 
Saudi daily al-Jazirah says the blast indicates that there is a `` huge collapse '' in the Syrian security system . 
`` It also proves that getting rid of Assad 's regime is imminent . '' 
But Syrian ruling party newspaper al-Baath is predictably defiant . 
It says `` traitors , agents and mercenaries '' are mistaken if they think Syria will stop `` producing martyrs , brave and faithful men who are ready for sacrifice '' . 
Among Syria 's non-Arab neighbors , Iranian hard-line conservative daily Qods says the appointment of a new defense minister , within two hours of the blast , `` points to signs of calm '' in Damascus . 
But it warns that any collapse of the government `` will result in civil war '' . 
Iran 's reformist daily Sharq acknowledges an `` unprecedented incident and a turning point '' . 
It adds that Syrian opposition forces `` are trying to show that Kofi Annan 's ` Peace Plan ' is a failure '' . 
Turkish commentators are sombre . 
Syria is rapidly descending into civil war , says Taraf daily . 
`` Worse than that ... Syria has turned into an arena where world giants are clashing with each other . '' 
The attack shows that Syria is at the point of no return , says Turkey 's Star daily . 
`` The bombs can make things much more difficult for Turkey . '' 
Israel 's Maariv daily predicts that the `` lethal terrorist attack '' may speed up the disintegration of the army , with consequences for the president . 
`` If a division commander decides that Assad has become a burden , this can bring the end closer . 
Assad is already on the slippery slope from which there is no return . ''
