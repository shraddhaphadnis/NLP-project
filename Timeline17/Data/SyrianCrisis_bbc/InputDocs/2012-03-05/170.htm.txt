Syria at risk of civil war , Cameron warns Syria is at increasing risk of `` all out civil war '' if President Bashar Assad remains in power , David Cameron has said . 
In a statement to the Commons , the prime minister said `` the history of Homs is being written in the blood of its citizens '' . 
Mr Cameron told MPs the UK was working internationally to secure humanitarian assistance for Syrians affected by the violence , to hold to account those committing `` atrocities '' and to bring about a political transition to put a stop the killing . 
He was updating MPs on 5 March 2012 on the EU Council summit which , he said , focused on Syria , Somalia , Serbia and Europe 's growth crisis . 
`` Syria 's tragedy is that those who are clinging to Assad for the sake of stability are in fact helping to ensure the complete opposite . 
`` Far from being a force for stability , Assad 's continued presence makes a future of all out civil war ever likely , '' Mr Cameron said . 
He added that Assad 's supporters needed to `` come to their senses '' and `` turn their back on this regime '' . 
Ed Miliband , leader of the opposition , said recent pictures and testimony coming from Homs were `` truly horrific , with women and fathers telling of their children being murdered in front of their eyes '' . 
It was `` appalling '' the Syrian government had so far `` refused requests '' for humanitarian assistance , he said , and called for a UN resolution to address the situation . 
On Europe , the prime minister maintained it was `` right '' the UK was not involved in the new fiscal pact signed by 25 out of 27 EU member states . 
He stressed it was important to ensure issues such as the single market are discussed by all 27 members , adding : `` That is exactly what happened at this Council . '' 
`` Far from not being included in the vital discussion that affects our national interests , Britain helped to set the agenda at this European Council and ... ensure its success . '' 
However , Mr Miliband accused the prime minister of being `` isolated without influence '' in Europe , claiming he had achieved nothing at the summit . 
The eurozone and non-eurozone countries will , under the new deal , limit their budget deficit to 0.5 % of GDP , in order to prevent a repeat of a sovereign debt crisis in the future . 
It is expected to come into force on 1 January 2013 , providing that 12 out of 17 current eurozone countries ratify it before that date . 
It will only be applied to the countries that have ratified it .
