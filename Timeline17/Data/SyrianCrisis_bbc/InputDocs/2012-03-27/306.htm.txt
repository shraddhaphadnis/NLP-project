Syria crisis : Clashes spill over Lebanese border Clashes between Syrian security forces and armed rebels have spilled across the border with Lebanon , witnesses and Lebanese security officials say . 
Residents of Masharia al-Qaa said soldiers backed by armored vehicles had entered Lebanon and fired at houses where rebels had taken cover . 
Lebanese officials said bullets had struck Lebanese territory , but that no Syrian troops had crossed the border . 
Thousands of Syrian refugees have fled to Lebanon in the past year . 
More than 1,500 crossed the border after troops entered the Baba Amr district of Homs earlier this month after four weeks of bombardment . 
The border area is also used by smugglers and the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , which wants to oust President Bashar al-Assad by force . 
On Tuesday , residents of the mountainous area of Masharia al-Qaa said Syrian soldiers had followed FSA fighters over the border with Lebanon and fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine-guns at them . 
`` More than 35 Syrian soldiers came across the border and started to destroy houses , '' one local , Abu Ahmed , told the Reuters news agency . 
However , two Lebanese military and police officials told the Associated Press that no Syrian troops had crossed into Lebanon . 
Syrian forces have reportedly fired shells into Lebanon and briefly crossed the border while pursuing rebels several times in recent months .
