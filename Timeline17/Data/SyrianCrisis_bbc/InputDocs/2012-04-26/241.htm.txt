UN official : We are afraid of Syrian refugee crisis 27 April 2012 Last updated at 03:12 GMT Help UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said the Syrian government is `` in contravention '' of an internationally agreed peace plan . 
Antonio Guterres , UN High Commissioner for Refugees , says he believes events such as a deadly explosion in Hama on Thursday will lead to increased rate of refugees attempting to flee Syria . 
Mr Guterres told the BBC 's Katty Kay that his mandate required strict independence , in order to preserve asylum spaces in all countries , especially as `` the old crises never die '' . 
`` The international community has not shown the capacity to prevent conflict and to address conflict , solving it quickly before it becomes protracted and before the humanitarian impact becomes sometimes devastating . '' 
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
