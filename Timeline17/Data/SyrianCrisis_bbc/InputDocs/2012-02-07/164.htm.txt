Demonstrations took place outside the Syrian embassy after armed forces attacked the city of Homs A Syrian and a German-Lebanese man have been arrested in Berlin on suspicion of spying on opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's government . 
The pair , identified as 34-year-old Syrian Akram O. and dual national Mahmoud El A. , 47 , are to appear before a federal judge on Wednesday . 
Their homes were searched by 70 officers who were also investigating six other suspects . 
They are suspected of spying in Germany `` for several years , '' a statement said . 
The federal prosecutor 's office said the arrests had come after `` an extensive investigation '' , adding that the other six suspects `` are also believed to have been involved in spying '' . 
Unconfirmed reports suggested the other suspects were linked to the Syrian embassy in Berlin . 
Last Friday , 20 demonstrators entered the Berlin embassy and , according to police , damaged offices there . 
The arrests come weeks after Syrian dissident and Berlin Green politician Ferhad Ahma , 37 , was beaten up by two men in his flat in an incident he blamed on Bashar al-Assad 's government . 
Reports indicated Tuesday 's arrests were not linked to the December 2011 attack . 
In a separate development , German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle is said to be considering the closure of the country 's embassy in Damascus . 
The United States has already shut its embassy and France , the UK and Italy have recalled their ambassadors for consultations . 
EU member states have begun work on further sanctions against Damascus and are likely to reach agreement on the measures on 27 February . 
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
