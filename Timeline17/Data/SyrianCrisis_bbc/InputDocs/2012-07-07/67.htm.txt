Syria crisis : Deadly cross-border shelling hits Lebanon Several farm buildings were hit by shelling in northern Lebanon , residents say There are fears the Syrian conflict will spread to neighbouring countries . 
The first artillery shells from across the border landed on farm buildings early on Saturday , killing one woman , local residents say . 
Two more people were killed in the second strike just hours later . 
Children are believed to be among the injured , with the Lebanese National News agency reporting that local residents were fleeing their villages `` in a state of panic and fear '' . 
It was not immediately clear whether the victims were Lebanese or Syrian nationals and whether the buildings were hit deliberately or caught in crossfire during a battle between the Syrian army and opposition fighters , the BBC 's Richard Colebourn in Beirut reports . 
The border area has become increasingly volatile in recent weeks , and fears are now growing that Lebanon could be sucked into the 16-month Syrian conflict . 
Like Syria 's other neighbors - Turkey , Iraq and Jordan - Lebanon has absorbed thousands of refugees fleeing from the violence . 
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
