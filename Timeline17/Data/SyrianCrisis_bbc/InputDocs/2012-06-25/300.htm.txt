Syria general and two colonels ` defect to Turkey ' The latest arrivals were said to have crossed near Reyhanli town and were taken to refugee camps Several high-ranking Syrian military figures have defected to Turkey , reports in Turkish media say .

Tensions between the two countries have escalated over the shooting down by Syria of a Turkish F-4 jet on Friday . 
The two pilots were reported missing after their plane went down in the Mediterranean off the Syrian coast . 
Syria has insisted the plane was engaged while in its airspace while Turkey insists it was in international airspace , 13 nautical miles from Syria , when it went down . 
In a news conference broadcast by Syrian state TV on Monday , Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said wreckage from the plane proved it had been shot down within Syrian waters . 
Turkish coastguard boats continued to search for the missing pilots on Monday `` The Syrian defense forces used an anti-aircraft gun with the longest range of 1.2 km . 
We can confirm the damage was caused by anti-aircraft fire . 
We did n't use radar for this action . '' 
Syria was committed to good neighbourly relations with Turkey , Mr Makdissi said , adding that if Turkey responded positively , Syria would act accordingly . 
The EU , which has urged Turkey to adopt a `` restrained response '' , is to extend its sanctions on Damascus in order to increase pressure on Bashar al-Assad 's government .
