Syria calms as ceasefire begins A ceasefire has begun between the Syrian government and anti-government rebel groups . 
Violence between the two sides has been raging in the Middle Eastern country for over a year . 
The United Nations say that 9,000 people have died since the fighting started in March 2011 . 
The truce , which was organised by the UN , seems to be holding with no reports of any trouble so far . 
The crisis started when Syrian people , inspired by the `` Arab Spring '' revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt , began protesting about how their own country was being run . 
President Assad , who 's in charge of Syria , tried to stop the protests with army soldiers and tanks . 
Fighting soon spread across the country . 
The ceasefire is part of a plan the UN has come up with to work towards peace . 
It also says that aid must be allowed into the country , and the Syrian people should be able to protest peacefully without being attacked by the army . 
No-one knows whether the peace plan will work - and some countries like America and Germany say they do n't believe the Syrian government will go along with the UN 's suggestions . 
For now at least , it seems that the violence in Syria has calmed .
