PARIS | Wed May 27 , 2009 11:37 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - More cases of humans transmitting the H1N1 flu strain to pigs are likely to occur , but will not be a major concern as swine are not severely affected by the virus , the World Organization for Animal Health said Wednesday . 
Canadian health officials said on May 2 a herd of swine in the western province of Alberta had caught the virus from a carpenter who had traveled to Mexico , the epicenter of the H1N1 flu outbreak that has spread to 46 countries . 
It is the only reported case of the virus being transmitted from a human to a pig in the world . 
`` We would not be surprised if we have other cases like this in other countries , '' OIE Director General Bernard Vallat told a news conference at the organization 's general assembly in Paris . 
`` But it is not a problem because we know pigs are not a big player in the epidemiological spread of the disease . '' 
The new H1N1 virus has so far infected nearly 13,000 people and killed 92 around the globe , according to the World Health Organization . 
Vallat reiterated flu viruses easily circulate between species , especially when strains are mixed . 
The new H1N1 virus , popularly known as `` swine flu , '' has human , bird as well as pig origins . 
The OIE , an intergovernmental organization of 174 member states , has often stressed there was no proof so far of transmission from pig to human . 
It was among the biggest opponents against the strain being called `` swine flu . '' 
The World Health Organization has also ruled out any risk of infection from consuming pork , saying the H1N1 flu had not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork , or other products derived from pigs .
