SINGAPORE | Wed May 27 , 2009 4:33 am EDT SINGAPORE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Singapore government on Wednesday confirmed the city-state 's first H1N1 flu case , a 22-year-old Singaporean woman who is being quarantined in hospital . 
The government has been warning Singaporeans for weeks to prepare for an inevitable H1N1 outbreak in the city-state , a regional financial and trading center and the world 's busiest port . 
The woman arrived from New York early on Tuesday on a Singapore Airlines flight , and was not picked up by thermal scanners at the airport as she did not have a fever then , the government said in a statement . 
She was in a stable condition . 
The government said it planned to impose home quarantine on around 60 people , mostly Singaporean passengers on the same flight who were sitting near the flu patient , and it urged them to report to the authorities for anti-viral medication . 
`` This wo n't be the last case in Singapore unless we could stop people from traveling , '' Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan told reporters . 
The government was continuing with screening at border checkpoints and asked people to stay at home if suffering flu symptoms . 
It also advised caution over travel to affected areas . 
Singapore financial markets shrugged off the news . 
Singapore 's central bank said in April that the global outbreak of flu clouded the outlook for the economy .
