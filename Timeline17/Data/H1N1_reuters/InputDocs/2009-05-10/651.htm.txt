Sun May 10 , 2009 4:12 pm EDT CAIRO May 10 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A five-year-old Egyptian girl has contracted the highly pathogenic bird flu virus after coming into contact with infected birds , the state news agency MENA reported on Sunday . 
The case brings to 69 the number of people confirmed to have contracted the H5N1 avian influenza virus in Egypt , which has been hit harder than any another country outside Asia . 
While the avian influenza virus rarely infects people , experts say they fear it could mutate into a form people could easily pass to one another , sparking a pandemic that could kill millions . 
MENA , citing the Health Ministry , said the girl from Sohag province was admitted to hospital on Saturday . 
It said she was being treated with the anti-viral drug Tamiflu and was in a stable condition . 
Some 26 Egyptians have died after contracting the virus . 
Most of those infected had come into contact with infected domestic birds in a country where roughly 5 million households depend on domestically raised poultry as a significant source of food and income . 
Last month , Egypt ordered the culling of all the country 's 300,000 to 400,000 pigs as a precaution against the new H1N1 influenza strain , also known as swine flu . 
The World Health Organisation on Sunday reported 4,379 people in 29 countries have been infected by the new virus . 
No cases have been reported in Egypt .
