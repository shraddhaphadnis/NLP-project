2009 06 24 07:14 JST CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. government is investing in a new technique for making flu vaccines that it hopes will help the nation respond quickly to outbreaks such as the H1N1 swine flu virus . 
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Tuesday her department had awarded a $ 35 million contract to privately held Protein Sciences Corp Inc of Meriden , Connecticut , to use its new gene-based techniques to develop a vaccine and test it in clinical trials . 
If testing goes well , the contract could be expanded over five years for a total of nearly $ 150 million . 
`` The technology has advanced in recent years to a point that we believe it could help meet a surge in demand for U.S.-based vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu , '' Sebelius said in a statement . 
`` We want to use the technology to help our nation respond to emerging infectious diseases . '' 
The United States has set aside $ 1 billion for a vaccine to combat the H1N1 strain that has caused a global pandemic . 
The cash infusion comes as Protein Sciences , which is developing a quicker way to make vaccines , fights to stay in business . 
Three creditors filed a petition on Monday in Delaware court seeking to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy .
