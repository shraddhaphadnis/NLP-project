WASHINGTON | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 6:32 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - What 's in a name ? 
U.S. pork producers are finding that the name of the virus spreading from Mexico is having an impact on their business , prompting U.S. officials to argue for changing the name from swine flu . 
At a press briefing , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack took pains to repeatedly refer to the flu as the `` H1N1 virus . '' 
Israel has rejected the name swine flu , and opted to call it `` Mexico flu . '' 
Jewish dietary laws forbid eating pork . 
The Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health also objected to the name , saying the virus contains avian and human components and no pig so far has been found ill with the disease . 
And there is growing sentiment in the farm sector to call it the North American virus . 
For U.S. pork producers the swine flu name has hurt , forcing government officials into the position of stressing that American pork is safe to eat and that other countries should not ban imports . 
Pork , soybean and corn prices have fallen in the last two days , `` and if this continues , obviously you have significant potential , which is why it 's important to get this right , '' Vilsack said . 
`` This is not a food-borne illness , virus . 
It is not correct to refer to it as swine flu because really that 's not what this is about , '' he said .
