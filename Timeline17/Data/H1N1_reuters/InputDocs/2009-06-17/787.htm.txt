-LRB- For a factbox on the outbreak click -LRB- ID : nLG76170 -RRB- BEIJING , June 17 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China plans to restrict movement in residential areas and shut down entertainment centres to prevent the H1N1 flu strain from spreading , under worst case contingency plans released by the health ministry on Wednesday . 
The ministry says stringent quarantine measures on incoming travellers have prevented the disease from spreading among the general population . 
With 264 cases as of Wednesday , and new cases cropping up around China , the ministry 's new plan seeks to address possible outbreaks in residential neighborhoods . 
Schools could be closed and meetings or gatherings delayed or canceled , the plan said . 
China has been eager to show it can effectively control H1N1 , after its cover-up of SARS contributed to the spread of that disease . 
Experts also fear the flu strain could turn more lethal if it spread widely in China , given the large population and uneven health services . 
Many foreigners chafed at China 's quarantine restrictions on travellers , which in some cases seemed illogical . 
The World Health Organization warned that China 's current policy is too resource intensive to be sustainable should the disease become widespread . 
Roughly one-quarter of the confirmed cases in China as of early June were United States citizens , the U.S. embassy in Beijing said earlier this month , suggesting that Chinese caution in quarantining hundreds of American travellers was justified . 
The WHO declared H1N1 a pandemic last week following a spike in cases in Australia .
