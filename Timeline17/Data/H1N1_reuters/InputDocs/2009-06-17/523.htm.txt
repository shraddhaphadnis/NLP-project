- So far , Europe has left it up to the United States , Russia and China to send people into space . 
But almost 50 years after Russia 's Yuri Gagarin made his first orbit around the earth , it 's about time that Europe finally enter the playing field , some say . 
`` Europe can not stay out of manned -LRB- space -RRB- flight forever , '' EADS unit Astrium Space Transportation 's CEO Alain Charmeau said at the Paris Air Show . 
Europe has its own space agency , ESA ; it has its own module on the International Space Station ; and it has sent its astronauts into space as passengers on the spacecraft of others . 
Launching its own manned spaceflight mission `` is not a budgetary issue , it is a matter of political willingness , '' Charmeau said . 
His company , which makes space launchers that carry satellites or other items into space and could make a lunar lander , would be one of many that would benefit from the additional business . 
Even outside the sphere of government-funded space programs , Charmeau said he expects to see more people going up into space , as paying tourists .
