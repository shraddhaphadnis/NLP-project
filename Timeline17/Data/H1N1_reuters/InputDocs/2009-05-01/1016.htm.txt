Davide Elias is a regular contributor to Your View and in the following blog recounts his experience covering the devastating earthquake in LAquila . 
Early on April 6 , the town of LAquila , central Italy , was struck by a strong earthquake . 
My home town , Brescia , is about 600km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- from LAquila . 
I wanted to travel to the quake zone to take some pictures . 
I headed to the area the next evening , taking with me two cameras and two lenses -LRB- a 10-20 mm and a 70-200mm -RRB- . 
I left my 400mm lens at home .
