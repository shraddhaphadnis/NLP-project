Check out the uptick in business at U.S. and Canadian drug store chains amid the swine flu scare . 
Hand sanitizers , antibacterial soap , face masks and gloves are flying off the shelves of drug stores due to fear of swine flu , also known as the H1N1 virus , but executives said it is too early to judge the impact in other retail sectors . 
The makers of such products , like Johnson & Johnson 's widely used hand sanitizer Purell , are ramping up production to meet demand . 
Even Kellogg , the world 's largest cereal maker , said it had seen some large orders from Mexican retailers that may be stockpiling in case consumers begin hoarding food in the wake of the flu outbreak there . 
However , officials there were encouraged by signs the number of new cases were dropping . 
The swine flu has spread to several countries , including the United States , where even a U.S. government staffer who visited Mexico City with President Barack Obama last month came down with flu-like symptoms that spread to family members . 
Tests are being run to see if it was the H1N1 virus .
