On April 29 it raised its pandemic alert to 5 on a 6-level scale . 
The virus is behaving much like a seasonal influenza strain , which kills 500,000 annually , by spreading rapidly and causing mainly mild disease , but severe illness in some people . 
The WHO said Mexico has reported 2,895 confirmed cases including 66 deaths . 
The United States has reported 4,714 confirmed cases including four deaths . 
Canada has 496 confirmed cases and Costa Rica nine cases , both with one death .
