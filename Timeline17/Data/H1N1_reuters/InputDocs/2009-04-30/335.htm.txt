Thu Apr 30 , 2009 5:11 am EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Here are some facts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how swine flu spreads in humans : \* Swine flu viruses typically cause illness in pigs , not humans . 
Most cases occur when people come into contact with infected pigs or contaminated objects moving between people and pigs . 
\* Pigs can catch human and avian or bird flu . 
When flu viruses from different species infect pigs , they can mix inside the pig and new , mixed viruses can emerge . 
\* Pigs can pass mutated viruses back to humans , and these can be passed from human to human . 
Transmission among humans is thought to occur in the same way as with seasonal flu -- by touching something contaminated with flu viruses and then touching one 's mouth or nose , and through coughing or sneezing . 
One of the most effective prevention measures is regular hand washing . 
\* Symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to those of seasonal influenza -- sudden fever , coughing , muscle aches and extreme fatigue . 
This new strain also appears to cause more diarrhea and vomiting than normal flu . 
\* Vaccines are available to be given to pigs to prevent swine influenza . 
There is no vaccine to protect humans from swine flu , although the CDC is formulating one . 
The seasonal influenza vaccine may help to provide partial protection against swine H3N2 , but not against swine H1N1 viruses like the one circulating now . 
\* People can not catch swine flu from eating pork or pork products . 
Cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 71 degrees Celsius -RRB- kills the swine flu virus along with other bacteria and viruses .
