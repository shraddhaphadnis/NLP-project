WASHINGTON | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 7:36 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Staying inside to avoid the flu ? 
Or perhaps you are not convinced yet that a pandemic would be scary . 
Either way , the U.S. National Archives has a solution . 
It has posted an online exhibit about the 1918 pandemic of influenza , the `` Spanish flu '' that took the lives of anywhere between 40 million and 100 million people , depending on the estimate . 
`` In this room were all stages of Indians lying dead or dying or advancing well to the conditions which followed the Flu , '' Dr. D.A. Richardson writes in one letter to the Bureau of Indian Affairs describing the conditions at a reservation in New Mexico in October 1918 . 
A nurse from Kansas , `` As many as 90 people die here every day with the ` Flu ' . '' 
So far the H1N1 swine flu virus has not been anywhere near as deadly , with 176 suspected deaths in Mexico , one in the United States , and mostly mild cases in nine other countries . 
The exhibit , here also has photographs of policemen , typists and nurses with masks and a trolley operator keeping unmasked passengers from boarding .
