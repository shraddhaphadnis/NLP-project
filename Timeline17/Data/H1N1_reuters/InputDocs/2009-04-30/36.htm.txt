GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- , bowing to pressure from meat industry producers and concerned governments , said on Thursday it would refer to a deadly new virus strain as influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , not swine flu . 
The new strain has infected 257 people . 
The WHO has confirmed eight deaths although many more people are suspected to have died from the virus . 
It derives from a swine influenza virus but the new strain has been found only in people . 
While it contains mostly swine flu genetic sequences , it also contains small amounts of human and bird flu virus genetic material . 
No pigs have been confirmed to be sick with it . 
WHO has consistently said the disease can not be caught from eating pork if it is prepared properly . 
`` There is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and pork products , '' it said on its website on Thursday . 
The name of the flu led several countries to ban imports of pork from Mexico and the United States , where the outbreak first appeared , and authorities in Egypt have ordered a cull of pigs . 
U.S. and European food industries and governments had been calling for a change in name to remove the link in people 's minds between the disease and pigs . 
The `` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' designation refers to a family of flu strains , including one of the current seasonal strains and the strain that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 40 million people or more .
