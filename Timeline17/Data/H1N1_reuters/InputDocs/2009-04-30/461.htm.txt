What happened to Relenza the other antiviral approved by the CDC and WHO ? 
A large number of countries own stocks of this antiviral treatment . 
It also works against seasonal flu , unlike tamiflu . 
Do you think that there is a new strain of influenza A virus is a highly resistant to tamiflu drug or not ? 
Thank you for your help . 
One may well ask whether Africa is ready for H1N1 ; I would guess the answer should be manifestly clear , since cases have been confirmed almost all over the planet -- except in Africa . 
Apparently no cases have been reported on the entire continent . 
Not only is Africa not READY for the virus , but the correct lab test kits probably have n't got here yet . 
I 'd love to kow the answer . 
Use IV -LRB- Banana Bag -RRB- if you do not have anti-viral drugs .
