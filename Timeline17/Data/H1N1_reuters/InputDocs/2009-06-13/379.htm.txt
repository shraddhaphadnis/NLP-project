2009 06 13 00:11 JST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic on Thursday and advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus . 
The United Nations agency raised its pandemic flu alert to phase 6 on a six-point scale , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is under way . 
`` With today 's announcement , WHO moves from an emergency to a longer-term response . 
Based on past experience , this pandemic will be with us for some months , if not years , to come , '' WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a letter to staff , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters . 
People aged 30-50 , pregnant women or people suffering from chronic conditions such as asthma , diabetes or obesity are at highest risk , Chan told a news conference . 
The virus has killed 109 people in Mexico , where it was first detected in April before spreading to the rest of the world , prompting the Mexican government to temporarily shut schools and businesses in an effort to slow its spread . 
Countries from Australia to Chile to the United States are reporting that the new swine flu virus is `` crowding out '' seasonal flu , becoming the predominant influenza strain , she said . 
For now the virus was `` pretty stable , '' but Chan warned that it could still change into a more deadly form , perhaps mixing with the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating widely in poultry .
