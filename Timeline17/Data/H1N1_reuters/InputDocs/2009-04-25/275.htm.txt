Sat Apr 25 , 2009 12:51 am BST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Health officials around the globe are closely watching an outbreak of a new kind of flu that has killed at least 60 people in Mexico and infected seven in the United States . 
Health officials have been warning that a new strain of influenza that can pass easily from person to person could spark a pandemic , a global epidemic that could kills tens of millions of people . 
Experts agree another flu pandemic is overdue . 
Here are some facts about past flu pandemics and pandemic threats : \* The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic is the benchmark by which all modern pandemics are measured . 
Some 20 to 40 percent of the worldwide population became ill and more than 50 million people died . 
Between September 1918 and April 1919 , it killed more than 600,000 people in the United States alone . 
In a normal flu season , about 36,000 people die in the United States , and 250,000 to 500,000 globally . 
\* While the very young and the very old are most at risk with seasonal flu , the 1918 pandemic primarily struck young adults . 
It disrupted the global economy . 
Many small businesses , which were unable to unable to operate during the pandemic , went bankrupt . 
\* The virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic was quickly identified , and vaccines were available by August 1957 . 
The elderly had the highest rates of death . 
The Asian flu killed 2 million people globally , according to the World Health Organisation . 
\* The 1968 influenza pandemic was first detected in Hong Kong . 
Those over the age of 65 were most likely to die . 
It killed an estimated 1 million people globally , according to WHO , making it making the mildest pandemic in the 20th century . 
\* In 1976 , a strain of swine flu started infecting people in Fort Dix , New Jersey , and worried U.S. health officials because the virus was thought to be related to the 1918 Spanish flu virus . 
Forty million people were vaccinated but the program was halted after several cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome , a severe and sometimes fatal condition linked to some vaccines , were reported . 
The virus never moved outside the Fort Dix area . 
\* H5N1 avian flu is the most recent pandemic threat . 
It first surfaced in 1997 and continues to infect humans who have direct contact with chickens . 
The H5N1 or avian influenza virus does not spread easily from one person to another . 
\* Since 2003 , H5N1 virus has infected 421 people in 15 countries and killed 257 . 
It has killed or forced the culling of more than 300 million birds in 61 countries in Asia , the Middle East , Africa and Europe . 
\* WHO has six pandemic stages . 
A full-blown pandemic requires sustained , human-to-human spread over many countries of a new and serious virus .
