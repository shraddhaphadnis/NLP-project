2009 04 25 08:50 JST By Alistair Bell and Noel Randewich MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A strain of flu never seen before has killed up to 60 people in Mexico and also appeared in the United States , where eight people were infected but recovered , health officials said on Friday . 
Mexico 's government said at least 20 people have died of the flu and it may also be responsible for 40 other deaths . 
It shut down schools and canceled major public events in Mexico City to try to prevent more deaths in the sprawling , overcrowded capital . 
Authorities said they had enough antiviral medicine to treat about 1,000 suspected cases reported so far . 
The World Health Organization said tests showed the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients was the same genetically as a new strain of swine flu , designated H1N1 , seen in eight people in California and Texas . 
`` Our concern has grown as of yesterday , '' Dr. Richard Besser , acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
Global health officials were not ready to declare a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and deadly disease such as flu . 
`` So far there has not been any change in the pandemic threat level , '' Besser said . 
But the human-to-human spread of the new virus raised fears of a major outbreak . 
Mexico 's government suspended classes for millions of children in Mexico City , where scared residents rushed out to buy face masks and kept their kids at home .
