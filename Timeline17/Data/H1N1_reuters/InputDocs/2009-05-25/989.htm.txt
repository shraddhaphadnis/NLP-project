SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico | Mon May 25 , 2009 9:19 pm EDT SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Puerto Rico on Monday reported its first confirmed case of H1N1 swine flu -- a 39-year-old man who had returned from a week-long eastern Caribbean cruise . 
The Dominican Republic said it was stepping up testing of people with flu symptoms after a Russian tourist who had spent 12 days at Punta Cana , the country 's premier beach resort , was detected with the virus after he returned home . 
The authorities in Puerto Rico , a U.S. Caribbean territory , said they were checking on the persons with whom the Puerto Rican man confirmed with the virus had been in contact after he came back from the May 10-17 cruise . 
They did not give details of the cruise ship he had been traveling on . 
`` This isolated case should not be cause for panic , '' Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortuno told a news conference . 
Dominican Republic 's public health secretary , Bautista Rojas Gomez , said although none of the Caribbean state 's citizens had so far been diagnosed with swine flu , the case of the Russian indicated the virus was present in the country . 
`` The virus is circulating . 
In the last few weeks the number of tourists in the zone has increased enormously and although this is good for the country economically , this increases the possibility of the virus circulating further , '' Rojas said . 
Two Chileans and a Peruvian student who had spent time at Punta Cana were diagnosed with swine flu after leaving the Dominican Republic , according to media reports . 
Caribbean countries ' tourist industries have been hit by the global economic downturn and fears of H1N1 contagion could deal a further blow to economies that look to foreign visitors to earn valuable hard currency . 
Mexico remains the epicenter of the H1N1 outbreak , which the World Health Organization says has been detected in 46 countries and has killed more than 90 people globally .
