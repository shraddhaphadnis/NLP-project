Biotechnology Company , Replikins Ltd. , Provided Advance Warning of Mexican H1N1 ` Swine ... \* Reuters is not responsible for the content in this press release . 
The company was able to state the likelihood of H1N1 outbreaks based on its patented Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- genomics technology , which examines specific regions in virus genes which have been linked with past epidemics . 
The April 2008 announcement , attached below as published on the Web , stated that in H1N1 the company had then detected the highest concentrations of these specific regions ever seen , except for those from the 1918 pandemic which killed millions of people . 
Today , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics . 
A synthetic H1N1 Replikins Vaccine is available for testing . 
A similar synthetic Replikin Vaccine has been shown to successfully block the entry of H5N1 virus into , replication in , and excretion from chickens . 
The company is able to produce these vaccines in as little as 7 days , rather than the many months needed for traditional vaccines , because they are synthesized at the peptide level . 
The following is the text of the April 2008 release in which Replikins was able to pinpoint the high risk of H1N1 outbreaks : -- H1N1 Influenza Virus with Highest Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- Since the 1918 Pandemic Identified in the U.S. and Austria Boston , MA -LRB- PRWeb -RRB- April 7 , 2008 -- Replikins , Ltd. has found that the Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus has recently increased to 7.6 -LRB- plus\/minus 1.4 -RRB- , its highest level since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic -LRB- p value less than 0.001 -RRB- . 
A rising Replikin Count of a particular influenza strain , indicating rapid replication of the virus , is an early warning which has been followed consistently by an outbreak of the specific strain . 
The current increase appears to be specific to H1N1 ; there was a concurrent 80 % decline in the Replikin Count of H3N2 , for instance . 
The current H1N1 appears to be rapidly replicating simultaneously in the U.S. and Austria . 
It may succeed H5N1 as the leading candidate for the next expected overdue pandemic . 
However , the same virus replikin structures detected by FluForecast -LRB- R -RRB- software in all three previous pandemics , namely 1918 H1N1 , 1957 H2N2 , and 1968 H3N2 , as well as in H5N1 , have not yet been detected in the currently evolving H1N1 . 
There is evidence that many factors , including virus structure , host receptivity , and the environment , together with infectivity and rapid replication , need to converge for a pandemic to occur . 
For H5N1 , the high human mortality rate , which peaked at over 80 % in 2006-07 in Indonesia , as well as current low infectivity , both appear to limit H5N1 's ability to produce a pandemic . 
Furthermore , the H5N1 rapid replication cycle which began in 1996 now appears to be over . 
The H5N1 virus produced less than 300 World Health Organization confirmed deaths over the past 10 years . 
On the other hand , H1N1 , with an estimated human mortality rate of only 2.5 to 10 % , but with much higher infectivity , produced an estimated 50 million deaths in the 1918 pandemic . 
A number of countermeasures exist today which did not exist in 1918 , however . 
Among these is Replikins ' ability to manufacture synthetic vaccines based on current sequences , with a seven day production turnaround . 
-LRB- end of 4\/2008 release -RRB- In the April 2008 announcement above , as published on the Web , Replikins stated that it had detected the highest levels of its specific genome regions ever seen in any virus samples , except for those from the 1918 pandemic which killed tens of millions of people . 
Today , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics .
