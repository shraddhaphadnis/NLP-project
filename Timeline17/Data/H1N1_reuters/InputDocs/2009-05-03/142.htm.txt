2009 05 3 08:53 JST MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mexico 's flu outbreak appeared to be stabilizing on Saturday but officials warned the unpredictable virus still threatened a global pandemic . 
Mexican officials said hospitals were seeing fewer new cases of people with symptoms from the new swine flu virus and cut the estimated death toll from the outbreak . 
`` It would still be imprudent to say that we 're past the worst of it but I do think ... we are in a stage of stabilization , '' Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told reporters . 
Costa Rica , Italy , and Ireland confirmed cases of the virus , which has now been found in 18 countries . 
In Geneva , the World Health Organization said H1N1 influenza had not spread in a sustained way outside North America , as would be required before the pandemic alert level is raised to its highest level . 
But it said that would probably happen soon . 
`` I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent because we are seeing the disease spread , '' Michael Ryan , WHO director of Global Alert and Response , told a briefing . 
Few are ready to take chances with the new virus , widely dubbed swine flu .
