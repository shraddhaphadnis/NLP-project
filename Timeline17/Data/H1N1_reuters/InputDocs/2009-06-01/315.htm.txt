\* Order for nasal spray vaccine against H1N1 flu \* Company sees potential for additional U.S. orders LONDON , June 1 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - AstraZeneca 's -LRB- AZN . 
L -RRB- MedImmune biotechnology unit has won an initial $ 90 million order from the U.S. government to make a live attentuated vaccine against the new H1N1 flu strain , it said on Monday . 
The potential exists for further additional orders from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -LRB- HHS -RRB- , it said . 
MedImmune 's vaccine technology , currently only available in the United States , is different from traditional injectable flu shots in that it is a mist sprayed into the nose , where the flu virus usually enters the body . 
It contains live , weakened virus that does not cause the flu but still prompts the body to mount an immune response . 
The HHS said on May 22 it was setting aside $ 1 billion to help companies develop vaccines against the new strain of H1N1 influenza sweeping the world . 
Experts say a vaccine against the new strain -- also known as swine flu -- would probably have to be given separately from the seasonal flu vaccine , which is a mixture of three flu strains reformulated every year . 
Vaccine makers are almost done with making the autumn flu vaccine for the northern hemisphere . 
MedImmune plans to begin shipping the first of 10 million doses of its seasonal FluMist vaccine to U.S. healthcare providers in August .
