Starting this blog was a costly decision . 
To be precise , $ 359 . 
That 's how much I paid Amazon last night when I ordered a Kindle electronic book reader to kick off my plan to document the impact of digital media . 
The Kindle is the missing piece in my digital life . 
I bought my first digital camera in 2000 . 
I ca n't remember the last time I purchase a CD . 
And since moving to the United States in September , I 've largely given up DVDs in favor of videos streamed via broadband . 
My life is largely free of the clutter of silver discs and boxes of photos . 
The Kindle and devices like it promise to do the same for printed media . 
But do I really want to give up books ? 
As appealing as I find Amazon 's promise that I can carry 1,500 tomes in a device as thin as a magazine , is a house without shelves of wrinkled book spines really a home ? 
And how can I share sections of the Sunday New York Times with my wife when I swap our print subscription for the Kindle version ? 
In the coming year , I 'll be exploring the cultural and business implications of the accelerating shift towards digital media . 
The forces that are reshaping the music industry and newspaper publishers are rippling to television and beyond . 
New social trends and corporate champions will emerge , just as Apple and the iPod changed the way we consume music . 
Names such as Roku and Boxee are challenging the relevance of the Blu-Ray DVD players that the big electronics makers want us to buy . 
Many of these trends are well underway in the United States and I 'll chart them through my personal experiences with the Kindle and other gadgets . 
With the help of my colleagues around the world and , I hope , our readers , I 'll also look at how they are taking root elsewhere . 
Your digital comments are welcome .
