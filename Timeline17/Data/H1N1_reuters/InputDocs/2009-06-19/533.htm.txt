2009 06 19 22:54 JST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. Congress on Thursday sent President Barack Obama a $ 106 billion bill to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars after political sparring that could foreshadow tougher fights over Obama 's agenda . 
The bill , delayed by disputes over quickly closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay and expanding support for the IMF , highlighted the difficulties Obama may face in Congress even though his fellow Democrats control both the Senate and House of Representatives . 
The bill contains $ 79.9 billion to continue fighting the two wars , $ 7.7 billion to address the H1N1 flu pandemic , and $ 1.4 billion in foreign aid for Pakistan , which is fighting Taliban militants spilling over the border from Afghanistan . 
`` The bill before us represents a balanced compromise between the issues and funding recommended by the House and Senate , '' said Democratic Senator Daniel Inouye , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee . 
The Senate voted 91-5 , with most Republicans joining Democrats to support it . 
Obama is expected to sign it into law . 
The House approval on Tuesday garnered only five Republican votes and 32 Democrats voted against it . 
Democrats have a commanding majority in the House , but still need to keep centrist Democrats aboard and win a few Republican votes in the Senate to forestall any procedural roadblocks mounted by the opposition party . 
After weeks of tense negotiations among the White House , Democrats and Republicans , lawmakers put limits on Obama 's efforts to close the controversial prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where more than 200 terrorism suspects are being held .
