-LRB- Reuters -RRB- Brad Pitt has said that he would consider executing those responsible for the BP oil spill if he was in power . 
The `` Fight Club '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven '' actor , said he usually opposed capital punishment but would make an exception if he could . 
He was speaking during a documentary on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , which was to be aired on Tuesday night . 
`` I was never for the death penalty before -- I am willing to look at it again , '' the 46-year-old said when asked about the situation . 
The actor was talking during the screening of `` If God Is Willing And Da Creek Do n't Rise , '' a fim by director Spike Lee to mark the fifth anniversary of the hurricane which devastated much of the southern states . 
Pitt has been involved in rebuilding part of New Orleans , with the Make It Right project to build 150 affordable and sustaineable homes there . 
Lee originally intended to end the documentary on a `` high '' but said he felt he had to include the oil spill when it happened . 
Nearly five million barrels of oil leaked into the ocean during the 87-day leak . 
The leak was finally halted on July 15 although BP is still working on a way of ensuring the hole is permanently blocked , with officials saying that will not happen until September because key equipment needs to be replaced .
