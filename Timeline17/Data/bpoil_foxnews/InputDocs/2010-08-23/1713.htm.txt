`` I do n't know why Obama ever trusted these BP guys ! 
They would lie to their mothers , '' Lee opines to GQ 's Mark Healy . '' 
-LRB- Former BP president Tony -RRB- Hayward does not give a -LRB- bleep -RRB- . 
The thing we do n't talk about is that 11 Americans lost their lives and it took seven weeks to invite their families to the White House . 
I 'm not trying to bash my man , but that 's a long time . '' 
Lee also blamed `` environmental racism '' for the slow response : `` If this oil spill would have reached the Hamptons , Martha 's Vineyard -LRB- where Spike summers -RRB- , Cape Cod , that -LRB- bleep -RRB- would have been fixed . '' 
The director was just finishing his latest documentary , `` If God Is Willing and Da Creek Do n't Rise '' -LRB- the follow-up to his HBO film on Hurricane Katrina , `` When the Levees Broke '' -RRB- , when the oil spill forced him back to the editing room .
