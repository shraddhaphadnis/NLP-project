AP JUNEAU , Alaska -- BP PLC is suspending construction of an oil rig off Alaska 's coast to review its engineering and design plans and ensure the Liberty project can be done safely . 
BP Alaska spokesman Steve Rinehart says `` a few issues '' were encountered over the last year in working to assemble the rig . 
He would n't define those but said BP wants to ensure the rig meets company standards . 
The project calls for using a manmade gravel island in the Beaufort Sea as a drilling base , with a rig drilling horizontally for six to eight miles to tap what BP estimates is a 100-million-barrel reserve of recoverable oil . 
Critics have questioned the approach following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . 
Rinehart says BP remains committed to the project . 
No timeline was given for construction to resume .
