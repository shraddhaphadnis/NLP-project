BP tried the `` top hat , '' the `` junk shot '' and the `` top kill , '' but with the success of its new cap on the busted well in the Gulf of Mexico , it looks like the oil giant is now trying out a Job Kill . 
BP has suddenly stopped awarding contracts for oil skimmers and protective boom to combat the spill in the Gulf , leaving hundreds of contractors out of work , an industry source told Fox News . 
DRC Group , which has more than 480 vessels in the Gulf laying boom and skimming crude in shallow waters , let go about 50 percent of its workers this week after BP changed course , the source said . 
The Alabama-based emergency contractors have been employing more than 750 fishermen , oystermen and oil response technicians since the spill began and have laid 100 miles of boom to prevent oil from reaching the vulnerable shoreline . 
But after 85 days of crisis work , BP finally capped its broken well last week , and appears to have changed its calculus in contracting work to manage the effects of the spill , the source said . 
There is still an enormous amount of oil in the water to be skimmed or contained with boom , but the source suggested they are backing off on those efforts . 
Many fishermen who have been employed in oil cleanup projects had been otherwise driven out of work by the oil spill . 
BP never signed contracts more than five days out because it did n't want to be left with outstanding liabilities if the situation at sea changed abruptly , the source said .
