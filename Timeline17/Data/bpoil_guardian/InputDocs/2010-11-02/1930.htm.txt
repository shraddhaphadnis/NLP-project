Company increases estimate from the Deepwater Horizon explosion by $ 7.7 bn Tuesday 2 November 2010 08.06 GMT A sea turtle covered in oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster Photograph : Lee Celano\/reuters BP said today it expects the cost of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster to be $ 7.7 bn -LRB- # 4.8 bn -RRB- bigger than previously thought , pushing the total bill to nearly $ 40bn . 
The oil giant announced the new charge to cover the cost of the Gulf of Mexico spill alongside its financial results for the third quarter of the year . 
It blamed the delays that dogged its attempts to seal the leak , along with higher clean-up costs and legal fees . 
The new charge knocked BP 's pre-tax profits for the third quarter of 2010 down to $ 1.8 bn , compared with $ 4.98 bn a year ago . 
In late July BP set aside $ 32.2 bn to cover the cost of the clean-up , more than the City had expected , a move which pushed the company into a record loss of $ 17bn for the second quarter of 2010 . 
At that time , though , the Macondo well was still leaking oil into the ocean , and was only finally shut off in mid-September . 
Richard Hunter , head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers , said the additional $ 7.7 bn provision was `` a stark reminder that the fallout from the spill will follow BP for some considerable time to come '' . 
The final cost of one of the worst environmental disasters ever could climb further . 
BP said that the total charge of $ 39.9 bn was its `` current best estimate of those costs that can be reliably measured at this time '' . 
So far , BP has actually paid $ 11.6 bn in total costs since the incident , but still faces ongoing clean-up charges , compensation claims , and probably a multi-billion dollar fine from the US government . 
BP owned 65 % of the Macondo well with two partners owning the remainder Anadarko Petroleum with 25 % , and Mitsui with 10 % . 
BP has billed Anadarko and Mitsui a total of $ 4.29 bn , but admitted that both companies are `` withholding payment in light of the investigations surrounding the incident '' . 
Separately , Mitsui revealed today it had received a $ 1.9 bn bill from BP to cover some of the clean-up costs of the spill . 
When the costs of the oil spill were excluded , BP 's operating profits for the quarter were 18 % higher than a year ago at $ 5.5 bn . 
Chief executive Bob Dudley , in his first results announcement since taking over from Tony Hayward , said they showed BP was `` on track '' to recover from the disaster . 
`` This strong operating performance shows the determination of everyone at BP to move the company forward and rebuild confidence after the terrible events of the past six months , '' Dudley said . 
BP also said that it would reconsider its current dividend freeze in February 2011 . 
Richard Griffith , analyst at Evolution Securities , said BP 's underlying performance was better than expected . 
Shares in BP rose by 1.5 % this morning to 430p , around a third lower than their value before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April .
