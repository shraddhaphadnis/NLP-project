Photograph : BP LLC BP acknowledges it posted on its website an altered photo that exaggerates the activity at its Gulf oil spill command center in Houston . 
The picture posted over the weekend showed workers monitoring a bank of 10 giant video screens displaying underwater images . 
The spokesman Scott Dean said yesterday that three screens were blank in the original picture and a staff photographer used Photoshop software to add images . 
The unaltered image with three blank screens . 
Illustration : BP LLC Dean says the company put the unaltered picture up on Monday after a blogger for the website Americablog wrote about telltale discrepancies . 
`` Anyone who has ever used Photoshop knows that this is an incredibly amateur job . 
I can do far better than this , and I tend to play with Photoshop for fun , '' wrote John Aravsois on Americablog . 
Dean says the photographer was showing off his Photoshop skills and there was no ill intent . 
He said BP has ordered workers to use Photoshop only for things like color correction , cropping and removing glare . 
The incident comes just as BP appeared to have reversed some of its problems , having capped the leaking well in the Gulf and seeming to have shrugged off takeover threats .
