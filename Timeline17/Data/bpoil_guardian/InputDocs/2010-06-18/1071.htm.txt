BP CEO Tony Hayward gives his statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee Photograph : Reuters It was , for Tony Hayward and members of a powerful congressional committee investigating the oil spill catastrophe in the Gulf , a mutually frustrating experience . 
The much-awaited inquisition of the BP chief executive saw him resort yesterday to the favorite defense of corporate America when hauled up before committees of Congress : `` I do n't recall . '' 
The strategy may have been legally prudent for Hayward , who was testifying under oath , but it did little to salvage the reputation of a man in the running for title of most reviled executive in America . 
It also wiped out any goodwill which he may have generated by having started off his testimony with an apology . 
Seven hours after the executive first walked into the wood-panelled room , the most significant admission the committee could wring out was that , maybe , someone at BP should have realized the drilling of the well was going horribly wrong . 
`` I think , in the light of what we now know , it is perhaps surprising someone did n't say that they were concerned , '' Hayward said . 
He also allowed that the well 's safety devices , such as the blow-out preventer , were `` not as fail-safe as we had believed it to be '' . 
Otherwise , the members of what is actually a sub-committee of the House of Representatives ' energy and commerce committee were repeatedly blocked when they tried to get Hayward to admit any personal and company responsibility for the catastrophe in the Gulf . 
`` With all due respect , Mr Hayward , I think you 're copping out , '' said Phil Gingrey , a Republican from Georgia . 
`` You 're captain of the ship . '' 
Henry Waxman , the energy and commerce committee chairman , accused Hayward of `` kicking the can down the road '' .

Hayward was told he should quit , mocked for his $ 6m salary , and asked to consider whether a firm with a safety record like BP 's should be banned from America . 
The discomfort multiplied when Hayward was made to watch a video of Natalie Roshto , widowed by the blowout on BP 's well , and reflect on a photo of a pelican struggling to escape globs of oil . 
At times , Hayward suggested he was too preoccupied with his other duties as chief executive to follow the progress on the Macondo , which was already known in widening circles as a `` nightmare well '' . 
`` With respect sir , we drill hundreds of wells around the world , '' he said . 
`` That 's what 's scaring me now , '' replied Michael Burgess , a Texas Republican . 
On other occasions , the former geologist disavowed his decades spent in the field for BP , saying he was not involved in , or lacked the technical knowledge of , the crucial decisions in managing the Macondo well . 
`` I was n't part of the decision-making process on this well , '' he said . 
`` I am not a cement engineer . '' 
The evasions , delivered in flat and impassive tones , infuriated committee members . 
`` I am just amazed at this testimony , '' one said . 
`` You 're just kicking the can down the road like you have nothing to do with this . '' 
Members scoffed at Hayward 's claim that he had in his three years as chief executive been devoted to improving safety , pulling out press clippings from 2007 in which he complained of `` excessive caution '' , and having too many people in decision-making . 
He also got short shrift for saying he was `` distraught '' about what had happened , following a request by Waxman for a `` yes or no '' on whether Hayward had kept to an expressed commitment at his appointment to focus `` like a laser '' on safety . 
`` I do n't want to know whether you 're distraught ; I want to know whether you 've kept your commitment . '' 
The anger was fuelled by what Waxman called an astonishing culture of `` corporate complacency '' . 
The committee reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from BP , but while it was widely known it had a `` nightmare well '' in the Deepwater Horizon , none of those concerns percolated up to Hayward . 
`` We could find no evidence you paid any attention to the tremendous risks , '' Waxman said . 
Through the day , that was the theme . 
Members would read out emails from BP engineers pointing to a disaster waiting to unfold . 
There were emails acknowledging a problem on the well , and others suggesting BP gleefully over-rode those concerns . 
`` Who cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine , '' said one email , which authorised a short-cut in positioning the well . 
`` It appears to me BP knowingly risked well failure to save a few million dollars , '' said Waxman . 
`` Do n't you feel any responsibility for those decisions ? '' 
Hayward replied : `` I feel a great deal of responsibility for the accident . '' 
But if the committee wanted further information on decisions to ignore warning signs , he would be of little help . 
`` I ca n't pass judgment on those decisions . 
I am not prepared to draw conclusions about this accident , until such time as this investigation is complete , '' he said . 
`` I simply was not involved in the decision-making process . 
I have n't drawn a conclusion . '' 
There were moments of sympathy for Hayward , and even light relief . 
Joe Barton , a Texas Republican , said it was shameful BP had been compelled to agree to pay $ 20bn into an independently managed fund for victims of the spill . 
`` I apologise , '' he said . 
`` I do not want to live in a country where every time a corporation does something wrong , it 's subject to a political process that amounts to a shakedown . '' 
Hours later , however , Barton apologised for his apology . 
Parker Griffin of Alabama , who recently switched from the Democratic to the Republican parties only to lose a primary election , suggested the devastation caused by the spill was as nothing against the dangers of cigarette smoking . 
`` The greatest environmental disaster in America is cigarettes : 60,000 Americans this year will die from cigarette-related diseases , so if we 're talking about the environment , let 's not leave that out . '' 
But the tone overwhelmingly was an anger Hayward failed to assuage and may even have inflamed . 
`` When you operate on our land and in our waters , you are only there because the public trust allowed you to be there , '' said Democrat Mike Doyle . 
`` You violated that public trust . ''
