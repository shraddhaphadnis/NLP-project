BP chief executive Tony Hayward in his own words The BP boss has had plenty to say about the Gulf coast oil spill . 
Not all of it has been entirely diplomatic Friday 14 May 2010 11.31 BST BP chief executive Tony Hayward leaving a government meeting in Washington last week .

However , earlier this week he sounded less sanguine when he admitted that the leak is being fought on three fronts : beneath the surface , on the surface and on the shore . 
At the `` subsea '' level , he said , this was the first time the industry had had to deal with any problems at this depth , and that there was a lot of `` real-time learning going on '' . 
Hayward promised yesterday that BP would `` fix '' the disaster , which is on course to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the biggest US oil spill in history . 
`` The only question is we do not know when , '' he said . 
That indicates little progress from last week , when he was unable to give a timescale for when the flow of oil would be stemmed . 
Nonetheless , he confidently declared on the Thursday before last that BP would `` bounce back '' from the setback . 
This week he insisted that deep-water drilling would continue in the US despite the growing environmental and political backlash , and came up with this memorable analogy : `` Apollo 13 -LRB- the unsuccessful third mission to the moon in 1970 -RRB- did not stop the space race . '' 
Initially BP tried to palm off all responsibility on to Transocean , which owns the rig on which the blow-out happened , but Hayward conceded at the beginning of last week that BP was `` absolutely responsible '' for the oil spill .
