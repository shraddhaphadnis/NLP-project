Photograph : Ho\/Reuters Shares in BP plunged as much as 20 % at one stage this morning wiping another # 14bn off the company 's market value after the oil producer failed over the weekend to stop its catastrophic oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico . 
BP has now lost # 44bn of its market capitalization since 20 April , when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded . 
By 10am the shares had staged a partial recovery from early lows of 420p , after their biggest fall in 18 years , but were still trading 14 % lower , at 427p . 
The company said a containment cap will be connected towards the end of the week , although the spill could worsen in the meantime . 
BP has spent almost $ 1bn -LRB- # 700m -RRB- so far attempting to plug the leak , but said it was `` too early '' to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident . 
The total bill could rise to as much as $ 12bn , according to UBS . 
The new strategy is the company 's `` best option '' , BP chief executive Tony Hayward said in a statement today . 
The company has received as many as 30,000 claims , mostly from businesses in the US states of Texas , Louisiana , Alabama and Florida , which involve loss of earnings or bereavement suffered by families of the 11 workers killed when the rig caught fire .
