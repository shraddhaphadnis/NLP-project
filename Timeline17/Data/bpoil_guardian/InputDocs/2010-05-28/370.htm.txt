News photographers and TV camera crews are claiming that they are being prevented from reporting on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . 
They complain that US federal and local officials , including coast guards , are blocking access to beaches where the effects of the spill are most visible . 
A CBS TV crew was threatened with arrest when attempting to film an oil-covered beach last week . 
On Saturday , reporter Mac McClelland was blocked by police from visiting an island in Louisiana . 
On Tuesday , a photographer with the New Orleans Times-Picayune was prevented from flying over the ocean after the plane company was issued with a temporary flight restriction after BP officials learned that a member of the press would be on board . 
The US coast guard insists that its staff and BP have gone to great lengths to accommodate journalists . 
A coast guard spokesman said : `` Roughly 400 members of the media have been given tours of the spill on either BP-contracted aircraft or coast guard helicopters . '' 
He defended flight restrictions as `` a necessary safety precaution '' . 
Private aircraft must get permission from BP 's command center to fly over a huge portion of the gulf . 
Reporters and photographers view BP 's influence as unhelpful . 
They are escorted by BP officials on BP-contracted boats and aircraft . 
So the company is able to determine what reporters see and when they see it . 
Associated Press photographer Gerald Herbert says access has been hit or miss , and that there have been instances when it 's obvious members of the press are being targeted .
