Illustration : Paul Scruton for the Guardian BP 's report into the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion has exposed deep failings in the company 's operation , categorising eight key failings . 
BP admitted today its managers on the Deepwater Horizon missed key warning signs in the hours before the explosion aboard the oil rig , but an internal investigation put much of the blame on other companies involved in the well . 
A 234-page report described eight main causes for the blast , which killed 11 men and created an environmental disaster . 
But BP was accused of attempting to pass on the blame for its conclusion that Transocean , the rig owner , and Halliburton , which carried out cement work , shared much of the responsibility . 
But the full report also contained - within the detailed analysis of the operation - a comprehensive , minute-by-minute timeline of every event , as it happened . 
BP have also produced a graphic video animation . 
It 's a fascinating insight into the events on the rig - you can find the key moments before the explosion - in which 11 crew members died - at around 21:49 on April 20 .
