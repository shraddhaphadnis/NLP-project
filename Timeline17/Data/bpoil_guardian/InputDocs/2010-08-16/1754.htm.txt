Announcement follows White House report that found BP received exemptions for its Gulf well based on decades-old data Monday 16 August 2010 22.20 BST Site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico : a White House report found that BP received environmental exemptions to drill the well . 
Photograph : Jae C. Hong\/AP The Obama administration is calling for environmental reviews for all new deepwater oil drilling , spelling an end , for the time being at least , to the kind of exemptions that allowed BP to drill its blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico with little scrutiny . 
The announcement came after a report by the White House Council on Environmental Quality that found BP received environmental exemptions based on decades-old data for its well that exploded in April , killing 11 workers and triggering the US 's worst-ever oil spill . 
Shallow-water drilling also will be subject to stricter scrutiny . 
The report sheds new light on the granting of those categorical exclusions , saying the exclusions BP operated under were written in 1981 and 1986 , long before the boom in deepwater drilling propelled by dramatic new technologies for reaching far into the sea floor . 
The report also finds other problems with how the Minerals Management Service applied environmental laws in reviewing the BP project . 
It notes , for example , that in assessing the likelihood of a major spill , MMS did not consider the example of the disastrous 1979 Ixtoc spill in the Gulf , simply because the spill was not in US waters .
