Photograph : Gerald Herbert\/AP Insurers Amlin and Hiscox have been hit by catastrophe claims and losses related to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . 
`` We had the UK winter freeze and windstorm Xynthia in Europe , we had volcanic ash and we had Deepwater Horizon it was an astonishing first half , '' said Robert Hiscox , chairman of the eponymous insurer . 
`` Mother Nature has shown how capricious she can be . '' 
It was the worst ever first half for natural disasters , according to reinsurer Munich Re . 
Following an uneventful 2009 , the industry was hit hard by the Chilean earthquake in February the largest insured natural disaster outside the US for many years and windstorm Xynthia , which tore through France in early March . 
Amlin had net claims of $ 167.6 m -LRB- # 108m -RRB- from the Chilean earthquake , out of total industry losses of $ 8bn , plus $ 2m from Xynthia , compared with industry losses of $ 3.4 bn . 
It was more heavily exposed to hailstorms in Australia , which resulted in claims of $ 18m , out of an industry total of $ 920m . 
Bermuda-based Hiscox estimates its bill for the Chilean earthquake and Xynthia will reach # 100m . 
Its retail arm , which sells home insurance direct to consumers , was hit by the winter freeze in the UK at the start of the year and has raised premiums by 4 % . 
Moreover both insurers had exposure to the BP oil spill which cost Amlin $ 15m and Hiscox about # 10m . 
Despite a 56 % increase in gross written premium , Amlin 's profit before tax dropped # 70m from a year ago to # 107.6 m in the first six months of the year . 
Hiscox reported a # 44m fall in profits to # 97.2 m , with its gross written premiums little changed at # 904.3 m. The oil spill reversed the fall in energy insurance rates lifting them by up to 20 % , in recognition of the increased risks . 
The worst spill in American history has affected insurance rates for deepwater drilling around the world and has also had a knock-on effect on marine liability rates because of potential pollution , said Amlin 's chief executive Charles Philipps . 
The disaster has also fuelled demand for insurance . 
`` A lot more people want to buy . 
Regulators are demanding that if companies are drilling in the Gulf they get X amount of insurance , '' said Hiscox . 
He was confident about the future , even though experts are expecting a worse-than-usual hurricane season this year . 
Unlike banks faced with black holes in their finances , insurers tend to bounce back quickly after a big disaster because they can bump up their prices . 
`` If it 's really big and hairy , a feast follows the famine , '' he said . 
He noted that the worst year for the insurance industry , 2005 , when four hurricanes hit America , was followed by several years of staggering profits . 
Amlin cheered investors by raising its interim dividend by 10.8 % to 7.2 p a share while Hiscox increased its dividend by 11 % to 5p .
