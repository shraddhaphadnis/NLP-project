BP tries to salvage status after Deepwater Horizon oil spill British oil and gas group 's chief executive says it accepts role as ` responsible party ' for clean-up A containment boom in Louisiana . 
Photograph : John Edwards\/EPA BP was fighting to save its reputation in the US , insisting the response effort was `` the largest ever mobilised anywhere in the world '' . 
The British oil and gas group , still bitterly remembered for the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 and for environmentally damaging pipeline leaks in Alaska , is reaching out to Louisiana communities , establishing town hall meetings and places for volunteers to enrol . 
It is also working with the local shipping community to make sure as many vessels as possible are available to help with the response effort . 
BP 's chief operations officer , Doug Suttles , denied that the company was not doing enough , insisting the response effort was `` the largest ever mobilised '' . 
Meanwhile , BP America 's chairman , Lamar McKay , told ABC News that the accident was caused by failed equipment , adding : `` We do n't know why it failed yet . '' 
The cost to BP is $ 6m -LRB- # 4m -RRB- a day , including attempts to cap the well , activate the cut-off valves known as the `` blowout protector '' , and to disperse the expanding slick . 
Independent estimates have put the final bill at between $ 3bn and $ 12bn . 
McKay said that efforts to trigger the blowout preventer were like carrying out `` open heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot-controlled submarines '' . 
Tony Hayward , BP chief executive , has stressed BP accepts its role as `` responsible party '' for the clean-up and has pledged to cover all `` legitimate and objectively verifiable '' losses caused by the disaster . 
Yet BP is privately seeking to draw a distinction between the Texas City tragedy , where it was found directly responsible , and the Deepwater disaster , where Swiss firm Transocean was drilling on its behalf . 
While the cause of the leak remains unclear , speculation centres on two areas : the `` cementing '' process to secure the well walls work that contractor Halliburton insists was completed 20 hours before the accident and the `` blowout protector '' . 
The equipment , supplied by US firm Cameron International , `` is the ultimate failsafe mechanism '' , Hayward said . 
`` And for whatever reason , it failed to operate . '' 
`` BP will be graded on the things that I established early on that were the goals of this operation , '' said Admiral Thad Allen of the US Coast Guard . 
`` The ability to stop the leak at its source ; the ability to attack the oil at sea ; to protect the resources ashore ; and to recover and mitigate the impacted areas . ''
