BP chief slips up on oil spill When the president of the United States is taking swipes at you and the share price falls 5 % , BP 's Tony Hayward starts to look very vulnerable BP 's Tony Hayward speaks at a press conference in Louisiana . 
His efforts to play down the Deepwater Horizon disaster have backfired .

This sounded like a blunt message to BP 's board to sack its chief executive since Hayward is , in a sense , working for Obama as well as the company 's shareholders . 
The president 's swipe at Hayward 's gaffes is also fair . 
The chief executive 's `` I want my life back '' comment was a bad slip but the line about the environmental impact being likely to be `` very , very modest '' was a straightforward blunder . 
But would sacking Hayward achieve anything substantial ? 
At this point , it might distract from efforts to contain and plug the leak . 
That judgment , however , would have to be reversed if the oil plumes reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration turn out to be substantial . 
Last week , Hayward was disputing the existence of the plumes . 
If he 's wrong , it 's a more serious matter than a few inept media interviews . 
Either way , in the long run , it looks increasingly hard for Hayward to survive this crisis . 
If the US president continues to demand his scalp , BP 's board has to ask whether rebuilding the company 's reputation would be best served by a change . 
BP 's shares today fell 5 % , briefly slipping below 400p for the first time since the disaster . 
It is hard to quibble with investors ' pessimism : when the president of the US is gunning openly for your chief executive , a fair price for the shares becomes a guessing game .
