However , after extolling the `` thousands of miles of beautiful beaches '' untouched by the spill and urging people to `` do a few things -LRB- to -RRB- help this community '' , America 's first lady headed back to Washington to prepare for a family holiday to a national park in Maine at the weekend . 
Conservative blogs , were quick to attack the Obamas for a `` do as I say , not as I do '' attitude , pointing out that the first family will have taken three holidays since the oil spill began in April , none of them in the Gulf region . 
The first saw them visit Asheville , North Carolina , as the Deepwater Horizon rig was sinking into the Gulf of Mexico . 
In May , Barack Obama was criticised for taking his family on a private trip to his hometown , Chicago , over the Memorial Day weekend instead of honoring fallen soldiers in a traditional service at Arlington National Cemetery , in Washington . 
Michelle Obama urged support for the Gulf coast in a speech at the Panama City Beach welcome center .
