Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise sets sail to investigate the BP oil spill The well is now capped but is the oil breaking down or settling on the ocean floor ?

Photograph : Ann Heisenfelt\/EPA I am on the Greenpeace ship , the Arctic Sunrise , We are about 4.5 miles off from the spot where the Deepwater Horizon oil rig went down , which is about as close as it is possible to get , given the official exclusion zone . 
It is a lot calmer now than the pictures that came out when oil was gushing out of BP 's broken well at full flow , with giant columns of smoke rising from the burn fields and a flotilla of boats nearby . 
I am told there are 26 other people on board , including two scientists affiliated with Texas A & M University at Galveston . 
This is a bit of a departure for Greenpeace . 
For the scientists , it 's a chance to get closer to an understanding of the fate of the oil that went into the Gulf . 
Is it being eaten by microbes in the depths , or did it simply sink to the ocean floor . 
A University of Georgia research team reported finding oil as thick as two inches in an underwater cancyon near the well . 
I will be writing more on their efforts in the next few days . 
As for me , I am testing out the effectiveness of chewing slivers of ginger root as a remedy for sea sickness . 
The Arctic Sunrise was designed and built as an ice breaker , and does not have a keel which makes for a rolling pitching ride . 
That might work well in Arctic waters . 
In the Gulf of Mexico , not so much !
