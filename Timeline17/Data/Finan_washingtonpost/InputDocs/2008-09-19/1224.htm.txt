Regarding the Sept. 17 front-page article on the government bailout of American International Group -LRB- AIG -RRB- , which was published a day after the op-ed column `` No More Creampuffs , '' about the government being willing to let large firms fail : It seems to me that the market is not really free if oil companies get huge tax breaks and financial institutions such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG know that the federal government will bail them out when they make stupid decisions . 
When the tenor of the federal government is to support and protect big business at the expense of efficiency , the environment , ordinary citizens and international relations , the `` free market '' is not operating as it should . 
Why are all the economic geniuses shocked at the collapse of Lehman Brothers -LRB- front page , Sept. 15 -RRB- ? 
Why should anyone be surprised at bank failures , given the banks ' investments in subprime mortgages over the past several years ? 
Their encouragement of rising housing prices made inflated values seem legitimate . 
Anyone with a brain knew that homes could n't be worth what the real estate agents and the mortgage lenders said they were worth . 
We just liked pretending that we were all millionaires because some assessment said so . 
So why do the financial pundits seem surprised ? 
Is it their fear about the economy or the realization that they 're no smarter than the rest of us ?
