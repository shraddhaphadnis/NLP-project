Dubai 's Eye-Popping Resort Debuts Despite Crisis Globe in a growing financial meltdown ? 
Great time to throw a $ 20 million party to open a $ 1.5 billion resort ! 
Last night in Dubai , in the United Arab Emirates -- the Vegas of the Arab world -- the Atlantis Resort opened with a massive party that laughed at the current economic crisis . 
Guests included Robert de Niro , Michael Jordan , Charlize Theron and an all-star cast of crisis-deniers . 
-LRB- CNBC 's Erin Burnett revealed on-air today that she got an invitation but did n't go . 
That 's just crazy talk , girlfriend . -RRB- 
The party concluded with a fireworks display that was supposed to be able to have been seen from space . 
That makes sense because the man-made , palm-shaped island on which the Atlantis sits , definitely can be seen from space . 
The rooms go for as much as $ 35,000 per night and come with their own butler and chef . 
Many have a glass wall view of the massive aquarium -LRB- sharks ! -RRB- 
at the heart of the hotel . 
Pretty much all you need to know about the resort is that it has a full-sized ziggurat inspired by the pre-Colombian peoples of Central America that doubles as ... a water slide . 
The massive terra-forming project has been called `` pharonic , '' but even the ancient Egyptian pharaohs did n't imagine a water slide down the side of the Great Pyramid at Giza . 
But it 's never too late . 
That is , if Egypt hopes to compete with Dubai for tourism dollars .
