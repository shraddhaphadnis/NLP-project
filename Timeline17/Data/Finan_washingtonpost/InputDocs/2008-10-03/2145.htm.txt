Of all the reporting and editorializing that I have read and heard concerning our current financial crisis , Marc Fisher 's Sept. 25 Metro column , `` A Street Where Businesses Still Have Some Sense , '' came closest to the mark . 
By describing the responsible behavior of a few local business folk , Mr. Fisher was able to highlight the core of the problem in terms we can all understand . 
These business operators based their practices on judicious use of their own cash along with money borrowed sensibly -LRB- repayable credit against real assets -RRB- and are prospering . 
They used real money to increase their ability to provide goods and services at a profit . 
Contrast that with the `` financial sector '' and its egregiously unsound business practices . 
Its current decline derives as much from misfeasance as from misdeeds . 
For years , many in the financial sector have been operating on -LRB- actually , buying and selling -RRB- `` money '' backed by assets that they have never seen and do not own and that in many cases do not exist in terms of real value . 
They have treated `` money '' as a commodity to barter for their product -- more money . 
That they did not own the commodity has come home to roost . 
It 's as simple as that .
