-LRB- AP -RRB- What might FDR say in a fireside chat during the financial crisis of 2008 ? 
Seventy-five years ago , the nation was gripped by a Great Depression .

Unemployment was 25 percent in 1933 and did n't drop to single digits until the U.S. entered the war in 1941 . 
Only one-third of Americans were high school graduates . 
Millions still depended on farms for subsistence , much less a livelihood . 
Imagine how far from Main Street Wall Street must have seemed then . 
In our time of financial crisis , when everyone from the President to the world 's richest person is telling us we 're near the abyss , it 's worth hearing what a previous president said when Americans actually were in the abyss .

Just imagine listening as a Dust Bowl farmer who could maybe only print his name . 
Some of these recordings are from his famous fireside chats ; others are taken from speeches . 
Each has at least one phrase that resonates eerily with today 's crisis .
