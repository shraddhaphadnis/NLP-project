The Recession Becomes Topic A in Popular Music Rugged N Raw 's `` I 'm Broke and Proud '' video , which finds gallows humor in the recession . 
-LRB- Youtube -RRB- For Neil Young 's next release , `` Fork in the Road , '' the venerated , if occasionally vexing , rocker has created a concept album about electric cars . 
But Young takes a detour on at least two tracks to work with a suddenly popular songwriting topic : the cratering economy . 
On `` Cough Up the Bucks , '' Young wonders , in his high , nasally whine : `` Where did all the money go ? '' 
And on the title track 's chorus , he turns indignant : `` There 's a bailout coming , but it 's not for you\/It 's for all those creeps hiding what they do . '' 
Young 's contributions are just two of the more recent entries to the rapidly expanding recession-music playlist . 
It 's a mix that 's spilling over with tunes by artists who sound dejected , determined , enraged , anxious and , occasionally , sort of amused by the financial meltdown . 
Indeed , the global financial crisis is providing fodder to all manner of musicians , from rock legends and country singers to folkies and rappers . 
Contributions from rappers are especially notable , with more and more hip-hop artists forgoing , or at least decreasing , lyrics about excessive materialism in favor of ones about the common man 's economic grind , as heard on recent songs by Jadakiss -LRB- `` Hard Times '' -RRB- , Cam ` ron -LRB- `` I Hate My Job '' -RRB- , Joell Ortiz -LRB- `` Bout My Money '' -RRB- and Willie Isz , a Georgia duo whose `` In the Red '' imagines a world without money . 
The members of Willie Isz have called the potent song a cross between John Lennon 's `` Imagine '' and the epochal Great Depression song `` Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' 
But it sounds more like a Southern-rap update of the Carter Family 's enduring 1930s anthem `` No Depression in Heaven , '' with Jneiro Jarel rapping : `` If everything was free , the world would be a better place\/For you and me\/Don ' t you agree ? 
There 's also `` Circulate '' by Young Jeezy , the Southern rap star who last year released a chart-topping album loaded with lyrics about economic struggle . 
Called `` The Recession '' -LRB- although at the time of its release , in September , economists had n't declared that the U.S. economy was in a recession -RRB- , the album marked a departure for the Atlanta rapper who became famous -- and , yes , rich -- spinning tales of dope boys living large . 
Although Jeezy did n't actually strip his lyrics of references to his Lamborghini , he was suddenly questioning his free-spending ways , rapping : `` Looking at my watch like it 's a bad investment . '' 
In an interview with XXL magazine , he explained that he was something like a hip-hop Suze Orman : `` When money was plentiful , I was the first one to tell you to stack it . 
Live your life with it . 
Now that money 's slowed up , I ` ma be the first one to tell you to save it like they ai n't gon ' make it no more . '' 
And yes , a wealthy rap star can still relate to the plight of the common man , Jeezy insisted . 
`` I got family members , aunts , uncles and cousins and friends that still live their life , '' he said . 
`` It definitely affects me when I get the phone calls and somebody 's about to get put out of their house ... somebody ca n't pay their bills and there ai n't really a lot of opportunity out there for you . '' 
In January , Nashville star John Rich dashed off `` Shuttin ' Detroit Down , '' a rant about the government 's hesitation to save the American automotive industry . 
`` In the real world , they 're shuttin ' Detroit down , '' Rich seethes . 
`` While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town\/And D.C. 's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground . '' 
Country singer-songwriter Phil Vassar seemed to have presaged the housing crisis when he was working up the title track of his 2008 album , `` Prayer of a Common Man . '' 
It 's a country-gospel ballad on which Vassar sings almost pleadingly : `` This house of cards I built is mortgaged to the hilt\/And it 's sinking in the sand\/Lord , hear the prayer of a common man . '' 
The old folkie Tom Paxton took a different approach in writing about federal bailouts , turning satirical on `` I 'm Changing My Name to Fannie Mae , '' an update of his topical 1979 song `` I 'm Changing My Name to Chrysler . ''
