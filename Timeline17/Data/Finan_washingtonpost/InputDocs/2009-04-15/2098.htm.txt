American minorities need to `` strengthen their financial literacy , '' Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told students and faculty at Atlanta 's historically black Morehouse College yesterday . 
On a day when President Obama delivered an Economic Crisis 101 lecture to students and faculty at Georgetown University , Bernanke was doing the same at the all-male school in Georgia . 
Bernanke was asked about the wealth gap between American whites and blacks during an expansive question-and-answer session following his speech . 
Some of the questioners said they had postgraduate jobs lined up as investment bankers , others in finance at large corporations . 
`` It 's absolutely right the difference between minority and white wealth is very significant , and part of that is related to income levels where whites have a higher average income , '' Bernanke said . 
`` But even if you control for income level , you find minorities have gathered less wealth . '' 
Part of the cause , he said , is a lack of `` financial education . '' 
`` There needs to be a broader understanding in minority communities , which have n't had that much exposure , about saving and building a credit record and being part of the mainstream economy , '' Bernanke said . 
Too many minorities do n't have bank accounts , he said , and `` borrow from payday lenders and cash checks at check-cashing services , '' which charge for their services . 
`` They would be better off in the mainstream banking system , '' Bernanke said . 
`` So one thing that could help would be to try to strengthen the financial literacy and financial education '' of U.S. minorities . 
Bernanke said Morehouse President Robert Franklin told him that the recession has forced some students to drop out of school , a situation Bernanke called `` an absolute tragedy . ''
