Thursday 31 March 2005 00.05 BST Acute malnutrition among Iraqi children aged under five nearly doubled last year because of chaos caused by the US-led occupation , a United Nations expert said yesterday . 
Jean Ziegler , the UN Human Rights Commission 's special expert on the right to food , said more than a quarter of Iraqi children do not have enough to eat and 7.7 % are acutely malnourished - a jump from 4 % recorded in the immediate aftermath of the US-led invasion . 
Reporting to the commission 's headquarters in Geneva , the Swiss professor claimed the situation was `` a result of the war led by coalition forces '' . 
If confirmed , the estimates would be an indictment of an occupation which was supposed to improve the lives of a population crushed by Saddam Hussein . 
Billions of dollars-worth of aid flowed into Iraq from the fall of Saddam Hussein regime 's in April 2003 . 
But the regime 's collapse and widespread violence destroyed jobs and made aid distribution difficult . 
Prof Ziegler based some of his analysis on a US study in October 2004 which estimated that up to 100,000 extra Iraqis , mostly women and children , had died since the invasion than would have been expected to before the war . 
`` Most died as a result of the violence , but many others died as a result of the increasingly difficult living conditions , reflected in increasing child mortality levels , '' he said .
