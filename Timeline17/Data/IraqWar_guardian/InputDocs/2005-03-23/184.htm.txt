The prime minister will face Group Captain Al Lockwood - who appeared on TV screens as a military spokesman during the conflict - in his north-east constituency . 
In a local contest which is shaping up to focus on Iraq , Mr Blair will also face anti-war candidate Reg Keys , the father of a killed military policeman , and David Shayler , the ex-MI5 spy turned campaigner , who have declared their intention to stand against him . 
Today the Tories officially selected Group Capt Lockwood to take on Mr Blair 's seemingly impregnable 17,000 majority , after their former candidate , Danny Kruger , dropped out following the Guardian 's revelation that he had called for a `` period of creative destruction '' in the public services . 
The former fighter pilot , currently living in Lincolnshire , left the RAF earlier this year and has chosen to pursue a career in politics . 
The 53-year-old 's face was beamed into millions of British households during the Iraq conflict two years ago in his role as the official military spokesman . 
He said today : `` I am proud and honored to have been selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for Sedgefield . 
`` I am looking forward to the challenges ahead and relishing the opportunity to take on Tony Blair . '' 
`` Since this government came to power the people of Sedgefield have been subjected to an increased tax burden of 60 % . 
`` Mr Blair promised to cut crime , improve school standards and not to raise taxes but he has failed to deliver . 
The people of Sedgefield have a unique opportunity to send a signal to Mr Blair at the next election . 
`` Seven years of failing to deliver on his promises is long enough . 
It 's time for him to go . '' 
Mr Blair 's agent , John Burton , responded today : `` The Tories can change their candidate but they can not change their policies , they are still going to cut # 35bn from the public services budget . '' 
Mr Shayler and Mr Keys are expected to meet soon to see if one is willing to drop out to leave just one anti-war candidate . 
Mr Shayler said earlier he intended to challenge the prime minister on the `` illegal '' invasion of Iraq . 
Mr Keys , whose son , Lance Corporal Tom Keys , was one of six Red Caps killed by a mob in a small police station in Al Majar Al Kabir in June 2003 , also intends to bring Iraq to the forefront of the election , and said he wanted `` justice '' for his son . 
Meanwhile , in the national election battle , Labor 's election chief , Alan Milbur , n accused Michael Howard of drafting in a `` dodgy '' Australian aide . 
Mark Textor , an Australian colleague of the controversial Tory strategist Lynton Crosby , is expected to arrive in the UK in time for the start of the official election campaign . 
Mr Textor has been accused of using `` push polling '' in Australia , where telephone canvassing is used to camouflage disseminating misinformation about the opposition . 
Mr Milburn addressed what he termed the `` Australian question '' at a Labor press conference . 
`` Mr Howard 's campaign is being run by an Australian . 
Another Australian is about to arrive , someone who has a pretty dodgy track record and reputation . '' 
The pair were a `` fly-by-night operation '' he said , and Mr Howard was `` flitting from issue to issue , enhancing his reputation as a serial opportunist '' , he added . 
A Tory spokesman accused Mr Milburn of attempting to `` divert attention '' from campaign issues . 
`` Lynton Crosby and Mark Textor are both very talented campaigners , '' he said . 
Mr Milburn 's deputy , Fraser Kemp , raised the issue yesterday but a Conservative spokesman stressed : `` They did not do it . '' 
The spokesman added : `` We would never do it here . ''
