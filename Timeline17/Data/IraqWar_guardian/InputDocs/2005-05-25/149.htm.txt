Wednesday 25 May 2005 00.02 BST It was a culinary rebuke that echoed around the world , heightening the sense of tension between Washington and Paris in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq . 
But now the US politician who led the campaign to change the name of french fries to `` freedom fries '' has turned against the war . 
Walter Jones , the Republican congressman for North Carolina who was also the brains behind french toast becoming freedom toast in Capitol Hill restaurants , told a local newspaper the US went to war `` with no justification '' . 
Mr Jones , who in March 2003 circulated a letter demanding that the three cafeterias in the House of Representatives ' office buildings ban the word french from menus , said it was meant as a `` light-hearted gesture '' . 
But the name change , still in force , made headlines around the world , both for what it said about US-French relations and its pettiness . 
Now Mr Jones appears to agree . 
Asked by a reporter for the North Carolina News and Observer about the name-change campaign - an idea Mr Jones said at the time came to him by a combination of God 's hand and a constituent 's request - he replied : `` I wish it had never happened . '' 
Although he voted for the war , he has since become one of its most vociferous opponents on Capitol Hill , where the hallway outside his office is lined with photographs of the `` faces of the fallen '' . 
`` If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration , to commit the authority to send boys , and in some instances girls , to go into Iraq , that is wrong , '' he told the newspaper . 
`` Congress must be told the truth . ''
