The Mail on Sunday 's fulminator-in-chief , tells James Silver why polemicists are so important , what he really thinks about David Cameron - and how he is proud of his foes but does not like being called bonkers Britain , as depicted by the Mail on Sunday 's fulminator-in-chief , Peter Hitchens , appears at times to stand on the brink of apocalypse . 
According to his columns - which are molten Old Testament fury shot through with visceral wit - we live in a land of `` burglaries , muggings , swearing , pools of vomit , MRSA , rave parties and traveller encampments . '' 
Those on council estates are `` surrounded by the tattooed , with their pit bulls and serial partners , crack dens , joy-riders , open-all-hours pubs and the rest ... '' For their part , the police are dismissed as `` wooden , officious twerps in dayglo jackets '' who have sided with the yobs and given up on crime . 
Of single mothers , he wrote : `` It can not be long before Britain has its first 24-year-old granny . 
When you abolish husbands and fathers that is what you get . 
As the rules of civilised life are swept away and the only people interested in getting married are lesbian clergywomen , there will soon be thousands of them . '' 
Hitchens lays the blame squarely at the door of the `` permissive society '' . 
`` Like several governments before it , Labor has actively encouraged promiscuity by undermining marriage , promoting ` alternative lifestyles ' and preaching immorality in schools - and , of course , by continuing to subsidise the results . '' 
Other weeping Hitchens sores include : immigration , which is `` limitless '' and `` unmonitored '' ; New Labor - `` a horrible rabble of fakes , wreckers and frauds '' who are beyond the pale for `` dismantling Britain as a free country '' ; the Tories - invariably dismissed as `` the Useless party '' ; the EU - `` horrible '' , `` a monster '' and `` anti-British '' . 
And leftwing intellectuals - hell-bent on turning the UK into `` a meaningless , history-free and cultureless wilderness '' . 
He may view himself as one of the last sane voices in an increasingly boisterous asylum , but there is little fire and brimstone about Hitchens in person . 
He is friendly , if a touch gauche , courteous and dapperly dressed . 
We sit at a small table in a smoky Italian cafe around the corner from Associated Newspapers ' Kensington offices . 
His baritone voice booms over the clatter of crockery and the snorts of the espresso machine . 
People on nearby tables find themselves eavesdropping as they stir their cappuccinos . 
I am fascinated by his use of language , the `` pools of vomit '' , the `` pit bulls '' and the `` abolished '' fathers . 
Does he really think that `` lesbian clergywomen '' are `` the only people interested in marriage '' ? 
He replies : `` Caricaturists are among the finest artists because they alert you to the real characteristics of the people they draw . '' 
I try another one . 
Is Britain literally being `` dismantled '' ? 
If you take the characteristics of the country as being a working system of law , institutions , morality , custom , that sort of invisible web of internalised beliefs and knowledge which makes it possible for society to function - then it is being very rapidly dismantled , yes . '' 
Hitchens , 54 , is well aware that many on the left see him as a swivel-eyed obsessive and , to a certain extent , he revels in his enemy-of-the-chattering-classes persona . 
He is , he proclaims , `` proud of his foes '' , even if over the years he has had to develop something of a thick skin . 
`` I know a lot of people consider me to be disreputable or foaming at the mouth , but you have to learn not to care , or at least not to mind . 
I do n't like being called ` bonkers ' and I think to some extent it demeans people who use phrases like that . 
But I take comfort from the fact that most totalitarian regimes tend to classify their opponents as mentally disordered . '' 
Hitchens ' political zealotry may be explained , in part , by his journey across the political landscape from former student agitator and `` Trot '' to doom-merchant rightwinger . 
He reveals he was `` much further to the left '' than many of his contemporaries at York university in the early 1970s . 
`` I got my jabs against -LRB- being a Lefty -RRB- in a way that they did n't . 
I got the full raging contagion , they just got a mild version . 
I get asked tediously how come you 're on ` the right ' when you used to be on ` the left ' , to the extent that these categories mean anything . 
What is much more interesting is that so many people who were leftwing in their student years are still leftwing . 
Why do n't middle-aged people who are at the height of their professions , well-off , paying large amounts of tax , generally part of the establishment , become Conservatives any more ? '' 
It may be hard to picture now , but he continued to deliver `` small bundles of the Socialist Worker to embarrassed people who 'd filled in a form '' , throughout his first job as a reporter on the Swindon Advertiser . 
However , he concedes : `` By then I was having doubts about the project . 
I joined the Labor party in 1977 and remember campaigning for Ken Livingstone 's parliamentary candidature for Hampstead in 1979 - with some reluctance as I 'd not voted for his selection . 
But I knew he would n't win . 
It was fairly guilt-free . '' 
Soon afterwards , Hitchens became a political reporter at the Daily Express and thought it `` no longer appropriate to carry a party card '' . 
His 24-year tenure at the Express , which included stints as correspondent in Moscow and Washington , came to an end soon after Richard Desmond took over the group . 
Desmond 's `` adult '' business interests prompted a bout of soul-searching in Hitchens , eventually leading him to quit for the Mail on Sunday . 
Does he disapprove of Desmond ? 
`` I do disapprove of him . 
How could I not ? 
It would be ridiculous if I did n't . 
I met him once and to my great shame and regret I shook hands with him . 
Good manners , I 'm afraid , prevented me from refusing to shake his hand . '' 
Another hand he has recently clasped belongs to his brother , Christopher , the Washington-based essayist and commentator . 
They fell out after an unfathomable row over a joke about Stalinism . 
They did not speak to each other for four years until they were reconciled publicly at a Guardian event at the Hay festival earlier this year . 
They have exchanged no more than a `` couple of emails '' since . 
`` We were never particularly close , '' says Hitchens . 
It has been suggested that there is a sense of rivalry between Christopher - the left-of-centre firebrand who famously backed the Iraq war , drawing the ire of many on the left who accused him of switching sides , and Peter - the moral conservative who speaks up for the silent , decent majority who cower behind their clipped hedges and memories of a better England . 
Peter 's slightly disingenuous response is that they are not in competition as they began in different journalistic fields . 
`` Christopher 's point of entry was commentary and essays . 
And I became a pundit by accident . 
I could always see it was an attractive billet . 
But the process of becoming one was a series of accidents . '' 
Unlike his brother , Peter Hitchens was , and continues to be , a vociferous opponent of the Iraq war . 
He never bought the WMD argument and felt `` his intelligence was being insulted '' by the Bush-Blair `` baby-talk '' . 
Did he admire his brother 's stance on Iraq - a position which has lost him many friends ? 
Hitchens grudgingly concedes : `` Sure , any principled position is admirable even if it 's wrong . 
It 's rigid positions taken for corrupt and disreputable reasons or because you are a coward which are to be scorned . '' 
It is notable that he refuses to offer his brother so much as a whisper of defense over the George Galloway affair , despite the Respect MP describing Christopher as a `` slug '' leaving behind `` a trail of slime '' . 
He says : `` I am not in that argument . 
The great New York debate -LRB- in which the MP and the columnist recently clashed over the Iraq war -RRB- seemed to me to be about two positions I have nothing to do with . 
One , if you support the war you are an imperialist , racist fascist . 
Two , if you are against the war , you are a toady of dictators . 
I do n't think either holds any water . 
As for Galloway , I 'll wait for the proof . 
He is much alleged against but I 'm a believer in the presumption of innocence . '' 
Hitchens believes the Tory party to be `` institutionally dead '' , frequently targeting the party for excoriation in his columns . 
`` The conventional wisdom is that Labor have stolen Tory policies , '' he says . 
`` The truth is over the past 50 years , the Tories have stolen Labor policies . 
The Tory party has never fought a single battle . 
It did n't fight for marriage , for grammar schools or a proper criminal justice system . 
In fact you will find many of the worst reforms of the criminal justice system were put in place by Conservative governments . 
And it fell victim to the belief that the market could replace morality or Christianity . '' 
Unsurprisingly , he is no fan of leadership hopeful David Cameron either . 
`` All he wants to do is be like Labor . 
He just wants ministerial cars . '' 
What does he make of the drugs row that has dogged Cameron 's campaign ? 
`` What matters is not whether someone has taken drugs , but what their attitude is subsequently . 
I do n't know whether Cameron has or not . 
But if he did -LRB- take drugs -RRB- and then said ' I strongly disapprove of it and it was a seriously wrong thing to do ' , then I would n't care if he 'd taken drugs . '' 
A question pops into my head . 
`` Have you ever taken drugs ? '' 
`` Yes '' , he replies , refusing to elaborate . 
Richard Littlejohn said that the true job of the columnist is to chuck beer bottles from the back of the room at those in authority . 
For Hitchens it is rather more than that . 
`` There is a part of the tradition of liberty which requires hecklers , but if that were all it was it would n't really be enough . 
The main thing I want to do is to introduce ideas into the public discourse which then people who are deemed to be respectable can take up in a slightly quieter fashion . '' 
Then the writer , who was once told to `` Sit down and stop being bad ! '' 
by Blair , adds : `` But then again hitting the prime minister in the face with a ripe tomato from time to time is good for liberty . '' 
And , one imagines , for the Hitchens soul .
