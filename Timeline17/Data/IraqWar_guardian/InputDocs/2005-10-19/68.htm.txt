October 19 2005 , Eyewitness : The first Saddam trial will focus on the 143 villagers of Dujail , killed in 1982 after a failed assassination attempt -LRB- scroll down to read more -RRB- . 
Dujail was bombed from the air , its palm trees and orange groves razed and thousands of men , women and children were arrested . 
At least 143 men were executed . 
Amid a grinding , bloodsoaked war with Iran , in which Iraq was tacitly backed by the west , few outside the town knew or cared about the price it paid for defying Saddam . 
Today , more than two decades later , the former president and seven officials will be tried for allegedly ordering and overseeing the killings at Abu Ghraib prison . 
If convicted they could be hanged . 
Saddam faces another 11 trials , including charges related to the gassing and mass executions of the Kurds in the late 1980s and the suppression of a Shia uprising in 1991 . 
Prosecutors have started with Dujail in the hope it will be a simpler , tighter case with a paper trail allegedly linking the killings to the Ba'athist regime leadership . 
Survivors have given witness statements and some may testify in person . 
A curtain has been erected around the witness box for those wishing to hide their identity . 
Dujail is divided over its sudden prominence . 
Some residents express pride but others are fearful - insurgents have kidnapped and killed inhabitants in apparent revenge for the trial . 
The town is Shia but the surrounding area is Sunni Arab , the rival sect which dominated Iraq under Saddam and now forms the core of the insurgency . 
The would-be assassins in 1982 supported the Dawa party , a Shia group with ties to Iran , now one of the leading parties in Iraq 's ruling coalition . 
It would be one of the great ironies if the gunmen who missed the president on that hot day in July posthumously achieved their objective .
