Sir John Scarlett , head of MI6 , has been accused of trying ` to sex up ' a report by the Iraq Survey Group , the body charged with finding weapons of mass destruction after Saddam Hussein was toppled . 
In an exclusive interview , Dr Rod Barton , a former senior weapons inspector in Iraq , has revealed extraordinary details of how Scarlett and a top Ministry of Defense official intervened in a report by the ISG early last year . 
Barton , who has worked for Australian intelligence for more than 20 years , was a special adviser to the ISG in 2004 as it prepared to report that they had found no WMD or any programs to build them . 
Such a report would have been politically damaging in London in the aftermath of the David Kelly affair . 
Speaking from Canberra , Barton describes how in January last year he received a visit in Baghdad from Martin Howard , deputy chief of defense intelligence at the MoD . 
Howard had been criticised for helping to ` out ' Kelly as the source of Andrew Gilligan 's BBC story alleging Downing Street had ` sexed up ' the September dossier on Iraq 's WMD . 
Barton alleges Howard ` spelt out ' that Britain 's preferred option was that a proposed 200-page ISG interim report should not be published at that stage . 
Barton claims the CIA overruled their UK counterparts . 
He alleges that after this Scarlett , then chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee , tried to get ` nuggets ' placed into a shorter report to imply that Saddam did have a WMD program . 
According to Barton , these were based on old evidence that had been investigated and shown to be false . 
It is understood to include suggestions that Saddam was developing a smallpox weapon and using research to create a nuclear program . 
Barton added : ` The US has finally come to terms with the fact they got it dead wrong . 
The UK is lagging far behind . 
They still have n't come to terms with it . '
