A small amount of the disease agent Francisella tularensis , or `` rabbit fever '' , was detected on Washington DC 's national mall during recent Iraq war protests . 
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said an environmental air monitor on September 24 detected the non-contagious disease , which causes sudden fever , chills , muscle aches and pneumonia-like symptoms but which is easily treated with antibiotics . 
Local health department officials said further sampling had proved negative and said they thought the bacteria had not been intentionally released .
