Al-Jazeera : the broadcaster has fallen foul of governments across the Middle East The Iranian authorities have shut down the Tehran offices of al-Jazeera , accusing the broadcaster of inflaming ethnic riots in the south of the country . 
Al-Jazeera said today it had appealed to the government to reverse its decision . 
`` Al-Jazeera assures its audience that it will continue to cover Iranian affairs objectively , comprehensively and in a balanced way , and calls on the relevant Iranian authorities to reconsider the decision to suspend its bureau 's activities , '' the broadcaster said . 
The Arabic news network was first to report the unrest in Iran 's south-west Khuzestan province near the Iraq border , which has led to 200 arrests over the past few days . 
The unrest was also discussed on al-Jazeera 's talkshows , prompting a government investigation into its coverage . 
`` We suspended its activity in Iran to investigate the network 's role in unrest in Ahvaz , '' Mohammad Khoshvaght of the culture and Islamic guidance ministry told state television . 
`` We expect the network to respect Iran 's national integrity and security . 
If it is proved that al-Jazeera committed a crime , it will be prosecuted . '' 
Al-Jazeera is popular among Iran 's Arabs , who are the majority in Khuzestan 's capital Ahwaz but make up only 3 % of the country 's population . 
Persians account for 51 % . 
Al-Jazeera , owned by the government of Qatar , has fallen foul of governments across the Middle East . 
It was banned from reporting in Iraq last year and has angered authorities in Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Jordan and Kuwait for its policy of airing opposition views and criticisms . 
The US government has also attacked the network for its coverage of the Iraq war .
