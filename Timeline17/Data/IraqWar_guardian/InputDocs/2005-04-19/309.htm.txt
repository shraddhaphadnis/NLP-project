Tuesday 19 April 2005 00.01 BST Iraq 's new rulers split yesterday over whether to execute Saddam Hussein if he is convicted of war crimes , with President Jalal Talabani facing calls to resign if he refuses to sign a death warrant . 
The Kurdish rebel-turned president said he opposed capital punishment on principle . 
`` Personally , no , I wo n't sign , '' he told the BBC . 
But he hinted he may abstain and pass the decision to the two vice-presidents , Adel Abdul Mahdi , a Shia , and Ghazi Yawar , a Sunni Arab , who with him comprise the presidential council . 
`` My two partners in the presidency , the government , the house , all of them are for sentencing Saddam Hussein to death before the court will decide . 
So , I think I will be alone in this field . '' 
Mr Talabani 's stance prompted a sharp rebuke from the Kurdish bloc 's main coalition ally , a cleric-backed Shia list . 
A parliamentary deputy and spokesman , Ali al-Dabagh , said the United Iraqi Alliance unanimously favored executing Saddam if so ordered by the special tribunal which is expected to start the trial next year . 
`` If the court says he 's a criminal , we will follow it , '' Mr al-Dabagh said . '' 
-LRB- Talabani -RRB- is the president , and he should follow the law . 
If he does n't want to sign it , he should resign the presidency . '' 
Meanwhile , a hostage crisis evaporated when security forces entered Madaen , a town south of Baghdad , and found no evidence that Arab Sunni gunmen had kidnapped scores of Shias and forced others to flee . 
Shia politicians were accused of gross exaggerations for having made claims of `` sectarian cleansing '' .
