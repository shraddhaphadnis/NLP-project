Exploitative ... The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael A British film about three teenagers ' drug-fuelled descent into violence has prompted an audience walkout at the Cannes film festival . 
The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael contains a gang-rape scene described by one critic as so violent `` it makes A Clockwork Orange look like a Britney Spears video '' . 
The film , starring Danny Dyer and Lesley Manville , was unveiled to an audience of critics at the festival on Sunday . 
Many stormed out upon seeing the scene in which a teenage gang break into the home of a TV chef , torture and rape his wife . 
The scene is `` a sequence excruciating beyond any in memory '' , according to critics from Variety . 
Screen International magazine described it as `` video nasty territory '' . 
Set in an English seaside town against the backdrop of the Iraq war , the film follows shy teenager Robert Carmichael -LRB- Daniel Spencer -RRB- . 
Although a bright student , he starts skipping school and taking drugs . 
He falls in with Larry -LRB- Danny Dyer -RRB- , who has just finished a prison term for drug possession and assault , and through him starts dealing ecstasy . 
In one scene , Robert watches the invasion of Iraq on TV while a heavily drugged teenage girl is gang-raped in the next room . 
That rape takes place off screen , but a second is shown in graphic detail . 
In a storyline reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange , the gang break into the home of TV chef Jonathan -LRB- Michael Howe -RRB- and his American wife Monica -LRB- Miranda Wilson -RRB- while high on drugs . 
They tie up the couple and take turns to rape Monica in an attack so horrific she bleeds to death . 
The parallels with Kubrick 's film are underlined by a soundtrack of classical music by Elgar and Purcell . 
Debut director Thomas Clay said he wanted audiences to feel `` shocked and disgusted '' by the scene and argued that gang-rapes happen regularly in war zones such as Bosnia and Iraq .
