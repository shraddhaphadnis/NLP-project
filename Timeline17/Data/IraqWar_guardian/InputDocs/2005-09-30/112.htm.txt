See more here `` Our communal spaces are being overrun with ads . 
Train stations , streets , squares , buses and subways now scream one message after another at us , '' writes the Seoul-born , New York-based artist Ji Lee in the manifesto that accompanies his Speech Bubble Project . 
So Ji Lee - a former designer for Saatchi & Saatchi , of all things - launched what he calls a `` counter-attack '' . 
He plodded the New York streets with 50,000 blank speech bubble stickers that he attached to advertisements . 
Then he waited for residents to add their own commentaries . 
The results - some of which can be seen on his website , Pleaseenjoy.com are a sometimes bizarre , sometimes trenchant commentary on life and consumerism in the US . 
As the manifesto puts it : `` Once placed on ads , these stickers transform the corporate monologue into an open dialogue . 
They encourage anyone to fill them in with any form of self-expression , free from censorship . '' 
The resulting captions reveal the anger about the Iraq war and the Bush administration : political messages are dominant among those on the site . 
They also reveal an unexpected supplicant quality . 
`` Please let me die in peace , '' begs ET from the basket of the airborne bike in the familiar image from the film . 
`` Date me -LRB- please -RRB- , '' demands a corporate drone in an ad for Apple . 
Even Gollum , of Lord of the Rings , becomes a figure of sympathy : `` Desperately seeking purpose , '' he pleads , in a poster for the movie . 
The bubbles have captured imaginations outside Manhattan , too : last week the site crashed , after receiving 50,000 visitors in a day . 
The next step , says Ji Lee , is an online version , and a book of the project . 
As he says : `` More Bubbles mean more freed spaces , more sharing of personal thoughts , more reactions to current events , and most importantly , more imagination and fun . ''
