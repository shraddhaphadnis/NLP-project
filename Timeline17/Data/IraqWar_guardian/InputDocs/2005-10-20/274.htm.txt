The Guardian 's Iraq correspondent , Rory Carroll , was last night missing after being kidnapped by gunmen in Baghdad . 
Carroll , 33 , an experienced foreign correspondent , had been conducting an interview in the city with a victim of Saddam Hussein 's regime . 
He had been preparing an article for today 's paper on the opening of the former dictator 's trial yesterday . 
Carroll , who was accompanied by two drivers and a translator , was confronted by the gunmen as he left the house where he had been carrying out the interview . 
He and one of the drivers were bundled into cars . 
The driver was released about 20 minutes later . 
Carroll has been in Iraq since January . 
He volunteered for the assignment and his coverage has been critical of the US-led coalition . 
Before Iraq , he had been the paper 's correspondent in Africa , based in Johannesburg , since 2002 . 
In the previous three years he had been based in Rome , where he covered the aftermath of the Kosovo war . 
He was born in Dublin , attended university there and worked for various Irish papers before moving to London . 
He has an Irish passport . 
The Irish government was last night in contact with its embassies throughout the Middle East to try to secure help in finding him . 
Alan Rusbridger , the Guardian 's editor , said : `` We 're deeply concerned at Rory 's disappearance . 
He is in Iraq as a professional journalist - and he 's a very good , straight journalist whose only concern is to report fairly and truthfully about the country . 
We urge those holding him to release him swiftly - for the sake of his family and for the sake of anyone who believes the world needs to be kept fully informed about events in Iraq today . ''
