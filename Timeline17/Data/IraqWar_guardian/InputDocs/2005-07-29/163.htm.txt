Friday 29 July 2005 15.34 BST The television debut of a new Iraq war drama from the creator of Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue and LA Law has proved highly controversial in the US . 
More than 4 million people tuned in to the Steven Bochco 's Over There for its first screening on the FX channel on Wednesday night . 
The ratings figures beat the 2003 premiere of cosmetic surgery drama Nip\/Tuck and made it the most watched show on cable TV , according to Nielsen Media Research . 
It is the first time that a TV series has been shown about a war that still rages , but Mr Bochco claims he has purposely steered away from making any political point in the series . 
`` I do n't want to politicise the show in any way , '' he said . 
`` I do n't think it 's relevant to the dramatisation of this war , and of the men and women who are in uniform and in harm 's way . 
`` I think the moment you take a political position , you 're not doing what art is supposed to do , which is to ask provocative questions . '' 
But as concern about the validity of the war in Iraq grows in the US - only 43 % of Americans predict victory , although a majority believes the war is just , according to the latest Gallup poll - the show has provoked mixed reactions . 
Gory battle scenes - in one an insurgent is blown up by a grenade and momentarily his legs continue to run - graphic language and discontent , confusion and fear among soldiers have shocked some US viewers and critics more used to the gentle humor of 70s series M \* A \* S \* H. The 13-part series , which will be seen in the UK on Sky 1 next year , follows seven soldiers and their loud-mouthed sergeant , and references real-life events , such as the abuse of prisoners by US soldiers in the Abu Ghraib jail . 
`` Do you have a bag for my head ? 
Do you want me to take my clothes off now ? '' 
shouts one captured insurgent . 
The Washington Post 's reviewer accused Mr Bochco , the show 's creator , of reaching for the `` bag of attention-grabbing cheap tricks '' . 
The New York Times said the show `` dramatises wartime slaughter and suffering that all too often goes unnoticed ; its expertly filmed scenes at times overshadow the soldiers themselves . 
The danger is that viewers could end up loving the war as much as they love the troops . '' 
And New Yorker TV critic Nancy Franklin said : `` There 's an overall pointlessness to the show that 's rather shocking , considering the outrageous lies and arrogance that got us into the war . 
`` But pointlessness may be inevitable in a country where , at the moment , to risk telling the truth - beyond the truth that soldiers die in war and things are tough on the home front , too - is to be condemned as unpatriotic . '' 
Christian title World Magazine barely contains its outrage : `` In accord with the antiwar movie clich , the officers are indifferent and incompetent , '' said reviewer Gene Edward Veith . 
`` But for all of the series ' ostensible sympathy for the front-line troops , it treats them with palpable condescension . '' 
While Betty Delgado , whose son is serving in Afghanistan , cried as she watched the show for the Daily News : `` It puts you right there . 
Just seeing it , it scares me to know that 's what he 's doing . '' 
USA Today critic Robert Bianco said : `` Setting a TV series in Iraq while the war still rages is a risky and , some have said , a presumptuous proposition . 
`` Yet by focusing Over There not on the war but on its warriors , -LRB- co-creator -RRB- Chris Gerolmo and TV icon Steven Bochco have turned risk into triumph , creating what may be the most harrowing and realistic portrait of warfare ever captured by an American television series , '' concluded Bianco .
