This is the text of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's address to his country Tuesday evening : `` In the name of God the most merciful the most gracious , my fellow citizens I speak to you in a difficult time testing Egypt and its people and which could almost push it toward the unknown . 
The homeland is undergoing critical events and difficult tests which have started with honest young people and citizens . 
They have the right for peaceful demonstrations to express their worries , but they were exploited very soon by those who wanted to exploit the situation to create chaos and destroy the constitution . 
`` These demonstrations moved from a civilized expression of practicing freedom of speech to sad confrontations which were organized by political groups who wanted to throw fire on the oil and to threaten the stability and provoke and create looting and destruction and fires and to block roads and attack national possessions and public and private possessions , and attacks on some diplomatic missions in Egypt . 
`` We are living together in difficult days , and what hurts our hearts the most is the fear which has overtaken most Egyptians and the anxiety which has overtaken them regarding what tomorrow will bring for them and their families and the future and destiny of their country . 
The events of the last few days impose on us all , as people and as a leadership , choosing between chaos and stability , and brings in front of us new circumstances which our army must deal with in the most wise of ways in order to protect Egypt 's interests and its children . 
My brother and citizens , I have initiated the formation of a new government with new priorities and initiatives which will respond to our young people 's demands and their anxieties . 
`` And in dialog with all political forces , we have discussed all the issues that have been raised regarding our democratic and political reforms and constitutional changes which they will require in order to fulfill these legitimate demands and the restoration of stability and security . 
But there are political forces who have rejected this invitation for dialog , holding on to their private agendas and without concern for Egypt 's situation , and with their rejection for my invitation to dialog which is still on .
