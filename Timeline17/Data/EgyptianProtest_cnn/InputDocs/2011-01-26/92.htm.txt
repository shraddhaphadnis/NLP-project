GOD BLESS iam egyptian used to live all my life with only one name of a president , having faith that it is gonna be better day after day and the situation is gonna be better , maybe i do n't know a lot about politics because am like most of the peoplke around the world only receiving information from public media and internet but i know that i ' v spended 4 years in my country without having a job andi do n't have any decent social life and am still supported by my father while am 25 and i have no dignity as a citizen on his own country . 
thats why i understand why someone could finish his life by burning himself and feeling no sorry for doing that -LRB- that is the only hope -RRB- am writting that comment now and i wish that iam not gonna be in trouble or any of my family , because we do n't have the right to say anything . 
support the egyptian revolution you could help 90 milion human to be really human Come to America . 
Good luck to you either way , Egyptian citizen . 
Every man or woman deserves the right to pursue their dreams of living a fruitful and peaceful existence . 
Good people around the world need to stop being so complacent even though it goes against their kind hearted nature . 
Evil thrives when good people do nothing . 
I do n't ever see people around the world upset because they are lazy whiners , but because they are not even afforded the chance to work hard for themselves and their families . 
We are all tired of the tricksters and snakes determining our level of existence . 
Hope all the best for Egypt and every other nation . 
@US Guy ... as if people get what they desrve . 
Over half of the world families starve as they watch their own governments take bribes from other governments and corporations to rob them of their natural resources . 
The nations that do the bribing and the robbing are the ones that struggle with obesity btw . 
I believe you 're emphasizing USGuy 's point . 
Perhaps it 's time people got what they deserved . 
Except for the right-wing thugs in Washington , only a complete lunatic would support this Hosni Mubarak and his henchmen in Egypt !!! Umm Obama visited Egypt and has always played nice with Mubarak . 
Where do u think the US sends terrorists for torture I mean questioning ?
