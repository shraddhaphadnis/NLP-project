France suspended the sale of arms and tear gas to Egypt , a spokeswoman for French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Sunday . 
It 's not clear how much effect the move will have on Egypt , which has been wracked by anti-government demonstrations for nearly two weeks . 
France did not deliver any arms to the country between 2005 and 2008 , according to a U.S. Congressional report . 
The United States is Egypt 's largest arms supplier by far , delivering $ 4.8 billion in weaponry to the country in that period . 
China was second with $ 500 million in deliveries , according to the Congressional Research Service report , `` Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations , 2001-2008 , '' published in September 2009 .
