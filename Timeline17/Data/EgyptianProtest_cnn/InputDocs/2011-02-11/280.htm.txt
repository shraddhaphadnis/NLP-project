Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- - Top American officials welcomed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's decision to step down Friday but urged all sides in Egypt 's rapidly unfolding political drama to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy . 
`` The people of Egypt have spoken , '' President Barack Obama said at the White House . 
`` Their voices have been heard , and Egypt will never be the same . '' 
Obama said the sudden conclusion to Mubarak 's three-decade rule was not `` the end of Egypt 's transition . 
It 's a beginning . '' 
The U.S. president warned that there are `` tough days ahead '' for Egypt but declared his confidence in the ability of the Egyptian people to `` find the answers '' they are seeking `` peacefully , constructively and in the spirit of unity that has defined these last few weeks . '' 
`` Nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day , '' he declared , promising that his administration is ready to provide assistance to America 's longtime Middle Eastern ally . 
Obama praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly over the past three weeks and urged it to help ensure a credible transition that , among other things , ends emergency rule , ensures the enactment of key legal reforms and brings `` all of Egypt 's voices to the table . '' 
`` The wheel of history turned at a blinding pace '' the past few weeks and disproved the notion that `` justice is gained by violence , '' Obama concluded . 
`` In Egypt , it was the moral force of nonviolence - not terrorism , not mindless killing ... that bent the arc of history toward justice once more . ''

Your viewpoint is yours , but do not report it as a fact . 
You owe your views the facts and not your opinions . 
February 11 , 2011 at 11:21 pm | Reply I find it very interesting that the US media and all your experts be they from John Hopkins or any other US institution , are now so critical about the Mubarack dictatorship , when it has been with US dollars that he has been proped up for 30 years . 
Where have all the critical intellectuals and US media been in the last 30 years ? 
The reality is that we continue to support anti-democratic governments and policies throughout the world to protect our `` interest . '' 
Egypt after Israel are the biggest recipents of US military aid . 
This has been reported a few times in mainstream media . 
But US complicity in Egypt and the oppression of the Palestinians by Israel continues . 
I wonder what type of government we will prop up in Egypt now ; We may hear that Egypt , Like Iraq , is better off now . 
As bombs go off in Iraq on a daily basis and they struggle with their tattered infrustructure , I wonder if they really believe they are better off after the US invasion of their country .
