Protesters in Egypt are responding in large part to a widening gap between rich and poor , one expert says . 
Analyst : The protesters `` all want the same '' as they oppose growing inequality Analyst : `` There 's a feeling a lot of people are being left behind '' Differences involve government structure and population makeup -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Protesters who have taken to the streets in several Arab nations of North Africa are angry at their own governments , and lashing out over some specific problems in their countries . 
But what they 're looking for -- and , in the end , what inspired them to stand up and demonstrate -- is very similar , experts on the region said Thursday . 
`` They all want the same , '' said Emile Hokayem , with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the Middle East . 
`` They 're all protesting about growing inequalities , they 're all protesting against growing nepotism . 
The top of the pyramid was getting richer and richer . '' 
Speaking to CNN about the recent demonstrations that have occurred , to varying extent , in Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia in northern Africa , and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula , Hokayem said the protesters were also standing up `` against a high level of police brutality . '' 
`` Fundamentally it 's a question of dignity . 
People 's dignity has been under assault for decades , '' he said . 
Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan and a blogger , put it this way : `` There 's a feeling a lot of people are being left behind . '' 
The protesters are driven by economic frustrations , `` discontent with authoritarian character of the regime , '' and the `` feeling that there 's no real representation '' -- although to different degrees in each nation , Cole said . 
Across all four countries , the protest movements are `` largely driven by young people '' and include a `` high proportion of the educated middle class , '' he said . 
There 's `` a feeling amongst that middle class that they 're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a ` blocked elite . ' '' 
The worldwide economic crisis helped trigger the demonstrations by adding to economic pressures at home , and showing up in things like petroleum and food prices , Cole said . 
But there are differences among the protest movements as well . 
In Egypt , `` the state probably has done more to protect people '' from rising food prices by offering subsidies , Cole said . 
The Egyptian economy was stagnant for decades , but in the past 10 years started to grow -- creating bigger differences between rich and poor , Cole said . 
`` And I think some of the protest is over the ways in which the labor movements have gotten left behind and have n't shared in the economic growth '' in that country , he said . 
Egypt cracks down on protesters Algerian forces clash with protesters In Algeria , where protests have been relatively small , the demonstrations `` look to me like an after-effect of the civil war that Algeria had between the fundamentalists and the secular generalists , '' Cole added . 
Yemen has also faced great internal strife , which serves as a background to the wave of protests , he said . 
The dire poverty in Yemen has also left questions about how many people have access to water , he said . 
`` It 's a deeply poverty-stricken country which is getting worse off . 
... People are desperate there . '' 
In Tunisia , the government was run by an especially small clique , `` a kind of mafia state , '' which people are railing against , Cole said . 
`` The tightness of that clique and the way in which it dominated the economy is beyond anything you see elsewhere . 
People just were n't being let into the system to benefit . '' 
Hokayem said that `` the key differences have to do with the makeup of these societies . '' 
For example , `` Egypt is more diverse , a much bigger country , '' while Tunisia has a `` pretty homogeneous population . '' 
Also , the military plays a different role in the different societies , he said . 
In Tunisia , it is `` small and underfunded '' and not a major instrument of power , unlike in Egypt , where the military is a much bigger player , he said . 
But while the context for each protest movement may be unique , `` at the end of the day , the real driver is psychology , '' Hokayem said . 
He noted two more key similarities among the protest movements : `` The Islamists do n't seem to be on the forefront in any of those countries , '' he said . 
`` Up to now , it has been a mix of separate leftist and moderate Islamic movements . '' 
And unlike other protests seen in the Arab world in recent years , the protests are n't against the West -- nor do they seem inspired by the West . 
`` The West is irrelevant in a way , '' he said . 
Grievances at home `` are driving all of this . ''
