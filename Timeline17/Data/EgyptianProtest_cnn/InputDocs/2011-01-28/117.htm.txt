-LRB- CNN -RRB- - President Barack Obama spoke to Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak by telephone and urged restraint Friday night . 
I told him he has a responsibility to take concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people . 
I 'm calling on Egyptian authorities to refrain from any violence on peaceful protesters . '' 
Stating that the White House is `` very concerned about violence in Egypt , '' he continued , I believe the Egyptian people want the same things as the rest of us ... a government that is fair and just and responsible . 
The U.S. will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people , he affirmed . 
`` This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise . '' 
Let 's see all the Obama-hating idiots from the previous post apologize for speaking too soon . 
Mr. President , do n't start what we ca n't finish , We are still in 2 wars and please advise but keep our troops out of it . 
January 28 , 2011 07:10 pm at 7:10 pm | January 28 , 2011 07:15 pm at 7:15 pm | The president has a very delicate terrain to move through . 
While the old foreign policy of supporting repressive regimes simply because they protect our interests should be done away with , because it 's selfish on our part , the role of Mubarak in making peace in Asia can not be totally discarded or ignored . 
Egypt may fall into the hands of Islamic fundamentalists , and given their record , both the US and Egyptians interests will unequivocally be sacrificed . 
A genuine political and economic reform should be our demand , while discouraging this mass demonstrations , that can leave Egypt vulnerable for extremists to capitalize on . 
January 28 , 2011 07:15 pm at 7:15 pm | It just may be that it is time for Egypt to adopt the wisdom contained in `` The Constitution of The United States of America '' !!! January 28 , 2011 07:16 pm at 7:16 pm | Finally , a president who REALLY and simply understands ... nothing more needs to be said . 
January 28 , 2011 07:27 pm at 7:27 pm | If the islamic radicals take over the governent we could have another Iran and not only we will be in trouble , but other Arab Nations and Isreal who is one of our few real friends in the world who would come to America 's aid id we were in trouble . 
January 28 , 2011 08:14 pm at 8:14 pm | How about calling on those `` peaceful protestors '' to refrain from committing violence , setting fires , and looting during this `` peaceful protest '' or is this ok ? 
January 28 , 2011 09:23 pm at 9:23 pm | The U.S. will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people , Yes , just like the US stood up for the rights of the Iranian people by supporting a repressive tyrant before the revolution , and then , not accepting that our puppet was gone , even funded Saddam Hussein to kill tens of thousands of Irani civilians . 
Egypt should watch out ! 
The US is coming to ` help ' the people of Egypt ! 
January 29 , 2011 01:16 am at 1:16 am | Nevermind the fact that American Foreign policy supported and still supports dictatorships all around the world ! 
Yes , America wih the Shaw of Iran to many others like Saudi Arabia 's dictator like king to all manners of individuals to better ourselves . 
This is the american way of doing things via feeding off of the ignorant population . 
Corporations own America and western values not the people who supposedly run the show . 
The question is are wwe an empire or an representative democracy ? 
Seriously ask yourselves this though and look into critica and proAmerican newspapers , peridocals , etc with plenty of books to find ou the hypocracy of America . 
Patriotism is for supid individuals in any counry that usually consist of 100 % of the population ofthe world .
