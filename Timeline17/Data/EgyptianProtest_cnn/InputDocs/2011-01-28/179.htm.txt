CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said he and photojournalist Mary Rogers were under an overpass and behind a column as protesters and police were clashing . 
Plainclothes police arrived , surrounded the CNN team and wanted `` to haul us off , '' Wedeman said . 
`` A big struggle began , '' he said . 
Wedeman said the police threatened to beat them . 
Wedeman said he urged police to give back the camera to show that Egypt believes in freedom of the press . 
He said the security forces declined to do so . 
Wedeman discussed the incident Friday on CNN 's `` American Morning '' and on CNN International , providing an account that unfolded between dramatic video footage of police in riot gear , clouds of tear gas and masses of people on the street . 
The security forces ' behavior Friday was in stark contrast to their reaction to first day of demonstrations Tuesday in Egypt when officers were relatively restrained , Wedeman said . 
In a separate incident , four French journalists were arrested in Cairo , said Bernard Valero , a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry , but details of their arrest were not immediately available .
