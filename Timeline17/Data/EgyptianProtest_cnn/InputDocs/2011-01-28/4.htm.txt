Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- - Just three days after a State of the Union Address that President Obama 's own aides say was 80 percent devoted to the economy and domestic issues , the pressing national security issue of unrest in Egypt has suddenly vaulted to the top of the commander-in-chief 's agenda as he struggles with how closely he wants to stand with a longtime U.S. ally , President Hosni Mubarak . 
White House national security spokesman Tommy Vietor said Obama has been getting regular briefings on the unfolding situation throughout the week , and the president got a special memo with the latest information on Friday morning . 
Why would the U.S be the ally of a country who does not respect it 's citizens ? 
The do not allow peacfull protest , shame . 
January 28 , 2011 10:43 am at 10:43 am | Pres. Obama is capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time ... He -LRB- America -RRB- will support the universal right of Egyptian citizens to protest bad behavior on the part of their government AND encourage Hosni Mubarak to institute some reforms . 
As far as counterterrorism cooperation is concerned , this will continue no matter what , as Mubarak does n't want extremists in Egypt any more than we want them proliferating around the world . 
Additionally , Egypt is # 2 in the amount of aid received from the US . 
They wo n't risk that . 
January 28 , 2011 10:47 am at 10:47 am | need this issue to settle down , they are very important to the region as a freind to the United States if anyone can help Mr. Obama can . 
and Hillary Clinton , can talk to the protesters and help setle every thing January 28 , 2011 10:59 am at 10:59 am | You know the economy or debt wont be at the top of Obama 's agenda : -RRB- January 28 , 2011 11:04 am at 11:04 am | Protect and Defend Freedom of Speech in the USA Nice to see somebody finaly woke up the President and told him something was going on over there and he needed to pay attention . 
His wishy washy indecisive style ca n't be very comforting for Israel at this point . 
Last thing Israel needs is a radical Arab regime on its border .

January 28 , 2011 11:17 am at 11:17 am | There is no easy choice in this matter : we support an evil despot , we oppose a long-time ally , or we no nothing . 
Whichever choice , it would be good if the President could get the support of Congress so we do it as one Nation , and not play politics with our foreign policy . 
Whatever choice the President makes . 
the right-wing propaganda machine will oppose . 
Personally , I think we should quietly support the protesters . 
At least put pressure on Mubarak , with threat of the loss of our financial support without reform . 
January 28 , 2011 11:19 am at 11:19 am | I wonder if it ever occurs to the Palins , Christies , Boehners , McConnells -LRB- and all the others -RRB- just how much weight of the world our President carries on his shoulders everyday ? 
Easy to mock with armchair ideology when it is n't they who are being called upon to make the hard decisions affecting so many millions who depend on this one man to do the right thing - 24\/7 .
