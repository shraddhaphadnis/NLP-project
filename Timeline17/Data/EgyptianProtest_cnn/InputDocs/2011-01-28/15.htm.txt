President Obama discusses the situation in Egypt with Vice President Biden and his national security team during the Presidential Daily Briefing in the Oval Office . 
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- - Just three days after a State of the Union Address that President Obama 's own aides say was 80 percent devoted to the economy and domestic issues , the pressing national security issue of unrest in Egypt has suddenly vaulted to the top of the commander-in-chief 's agenda as he struggles with how closely he wants to stand with a longtime U.S. ally , President Hosni Mubarak . 
White House national security spokesman Tommy Vietor said Obama has been getting regular briefings on the unfolding situation throughout the week , and the president got a special memo with the latest information on Friday morning . 
`` The president has requested multiple briefings each day on the situation in the Middle East , '' said Vietor . 
`` Today , he received a memo updating him on the latest in Egypt from National Security Advisor Tom Donilon . '' 
Vietor added that Obama will get even more on the latest intelligence on Friday during his Presidential Daily Briefing , which is focused each day on sensitive material dealing with pressing national security issues . 
Asked if there have been any direct telephone calls between Obama and Mubarak , Vietor said , `` The president has not called President Mubarak , but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which President Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed . '' 
The president publicly expressed some of those concerns about Mubarak 's reaction to the protests on Wednesday , during a Q&A session moderated by You Tube in which Obama took questions from the general public . 
`` My main hope right now is , is that violence is not the answer in solving these problems in Egypt , so the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence , and the people on the streets have to be careful about not resorting to violence , '' Obama said . 
`` And I think that it is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . '' 
Obama and top officials in his administration are in the awkward position of deciding how closely to stand with the repressive Mubarak , who has been in power for 30 years and is now cracking down on protesters and cutting off social media . 
`` As I said in my State of the Union speech , there are certain core values that we believe in as Americans that we believe are universal : freedom of speech , freedom of expression , people being able to use social networking or any other mechanisms to communicate with each other and express their concerns , '' Obama said . 
`` And that I think is no less true in the Arab world than it is here in the United States . '' 
It 's hard to overstate how pivotal Mubarak has been to the U.S. in bringing stability to the region over the years , including help to the Obama administration on building international support to stop Iran 's nuclear ambitions as well as trying to bring together the Israelis and Palestinians in efforts to forge Mideast peace . 
All of that makes this a tough balancing act for Obama . 
`` Let me say , first of all , that Egypt has been an ally of ours on a lot of critical issues , '' Obama said during the You Tube session . 
`` They made peace with Israel . 
President Mubarak has been very helpful on a range of tough issues in the Middle East . 
But I 've always said to him that making sure that they are moving forward on reform - political reform , economic reform - is absolutely critical to the long-term well-being of Egypt . 
And you can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets . 
When the protests first sprung up earlier in the week , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was twice asked if the White House still backed Mubarak directly , and he twice fell back on quotes declaring that Egypt in general is an ally of the U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is also trying to walk that same fine line , refusing to call the Egyptian leader a dictator in an interview with PBS on Thursday , while also noting that Mubarak needs to make changes to his government and let his people taste freedom . 
Asked specifically by Jim Lehrer if it is time for Mubarak to `` stand aside , '' Biden said , `` No I think the time has come for President Mubarak to move in the direction to be more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there . '' 
Biden added the protesters are `` middle class folks who are looking for a little more access a little more opportunity and the two things we 've been saying Jim is that violence is n't appropriate and people have the right to protest and so we think that I hope I think that Mubarak president Mubarak will is going to respond to the legitimate concerns that are being raised . '' 
Presidents need to pay attention to major international movements . 
That does not mean he 's not interested in jobs . 
January 28 , 2011 at 12:44 pm | Reply CNN did n't keep the comments open for the Christie article , I wanted to correct the reporter . 
The headline is FALSE , my post : First he did n't `` direct fire '' at both sides , he said : `` Both parties have within them members who are afraid to step out and afraid to tell the truth because they 've seen the demagoguery of the past and what happened to people who got in way of that demagoguery , '' He is talking about Democrats like Charles Schumer who accuses people of `` Stealing SS checks '' from older and sick Americans as soon as someone proposes a change in Soc Sec . 
The demagoguery comes from the left , the Dems and the liberal news media , to the point that they will be happier to keep power and win elections then solve the real long term financial problems of SS , Medicare and Medicade .

January 30 , 2011 at 3:57 am | Reply I pray President Obama remains cautious about what 's happening in Egypt and not rush into something like our previous President . 
It 's always the possibility we can make things worst and also be blamed for interferring . 
There comes a time when foreign countries need to take care of their own differences , we ca n't police the World alone without the aid of the International community .

What was Bush 's war is now Obama 's . 
He must be man enough to see it through . 
You people keep arguing that it was not necessary . 
I do n't know where you got your information from . 
The whole middle east needed to have been invaded , but we ca n't do it by ourselves . 
We need soldiers and most certainly need the people behind us . 
You can argue alL day long that Iraq did n't need to be included into our war , but you are wrong . 
You need to know the facts and will not know them until fifteen years have passed at the end of the war .

Does Israel really want a prosperous , liberated , and free Egypt ? 
Sadly , I think Israel would rather have stability at any cost as a next door neighbor rather than an emboldened and dynamic true democracy in Egypt . 
One thing is for sure - Israel is self serving at grave cost to morality and justice in the region . 
Does Judaic law and principles stop at the Israeli border ?

We -LRB- the US and World -RRB- all know the US has given him Billions , supported him and looked the other way about human rights issues . 
We are rewarding them for their actions towards Israel , mainting Suez Canal and allowing US military bases in the Region . 
It 's a sham as big as every Mubarak Election . 
Please do n't dont make us appear as fools as Joe . 
We must side now , on our fundamentals , we support governments for the people and by the people ... always , it 's always about people . 
Help the people of Egypt to manifest they 're own destiny Sir . 
It 's what we are supposed to be doing . 
January 28 , 2011 at 1:02 pm | Reply Dear Obama and Biden , for you to ask that Mubarak merely `` reform '' and that Egyptians accept the continuation of his rule is like asking a battered woman who finally has the courage to walk away to return to her perpetually abusive husband , should he get some counseling . 
But I guess it 's hard to see clearly when that husband happens to be your friend ... January 28 , 2011 at 1:13 pm | Reply The President and all politicians should watch what is happening in Egypt and Tunnisa . 
When the chasm between rich and poor grows wide enough in this information age , it quickly leads to the civil upheavals and open revolt . 
Do the right thing pls .

Barack Obama is most assuredly not an idiot . 
His grammar and geography are nothing short of spectacular compared to his predecessor 's But what about his heart ? 
When President Obama was asked in 2009 if he regarded Mubarak as authoritarian , his swift reply was no . 
He called him a peacemaker -LRB- John Pilger -RRB- . 
A peacemaker who tortures his own people ??? Another high and tmghiy one , Tony Blair , pontificated from his own throne : Mubarak is a force for good . 
And when Joe Biden was asked recently on PBS whether Mubarak was a dictator , he responded : Mubarak has been an ally of ours in a number of things and he 's been very responsible I would not refer to him as a dictator . 
-LRB- January 27 , 2001 -RRB- . 
These three , particularly intelligent and especially well-briefed tmghiy ones , can not possibly plead ignorance What contempt therefore for the pain and despair of the Egyptian people ! 
And what disdain for the intelligence and fairmindedness of the American people ! 
If I were the Heavenly One Glory Be to Him and to Her Alone ! 
I daresay I too would have a mind to kick a few too-comfortably enthroned butts March 2 , 2012 at 11:13 am | That is sweet Obama is worry about what is going on in Egypt but he should n't be meddleling in that county 's affair . 
Let them be and focus on us !! Stop policing the wolrd and pay attention to us ! 
You know , the american people , the ones that pays your check ! 
January 28 , 2011 at 1:47 pm | Reply First of all , part of the POTUS earning his paycheck involves protecting U.S. interests in the world . 
Since Egypt is an important ally of the US and plays a key role in the stabilization of the middle east , I believe that qualifies as a US interest . 
Unfortunately , stabilization of middle east is important because the US is dependent upon their oil - perhaps if the right wing you hail from would support this administration 's or previous administration 's efforts to reduce dependence on foreign oil , stabilization of the middle east would not be so important for our country . 
Second of all , at this time he is only monitoring the situation . 
Third of all , Fox News called and wants you to report to their blogs . 
January 28 , 2011 at 3:15 pm | Reply AND NOW YOU MORONS WANT THE ISLAMICS TO TAKE CHARGE OF EGYPT . 
IN TWO WARS THEY HAVE SUPPLIED US WITH LANDING STRIPS TO GET OUR PEOPLE IN AND OUT OF IRAQ . 
BUT OF COURSE THOSE WARS WAS N'T NEEDED RIGHT . 
JUST BECAUSE YOU IDIOTS SAY SO . 
AFTER ALL THE ATROCITIES THAT HUSSAIN HAD DONE AND THE GOOD HE DID DO FOR BIN LADEN . 
WE SHOULD HAVE TURNED THE OTHER CHEEK AFTER 911 RIGHT ? 
THESE WARS HAVE LASTED LONGER THAN VIETNAME WE HAVE ONLY LOST REGRETTABLY A LITTLE OVER 5,000 TROOPS . 
IN VIETNAM WE LOST OVER 58,000 . 
YOU PEOPLE WANT OUR GUNS TAKEN AWAY AS DOES OBAMA . 
HIS PLAN IS TO DESTROY AMERICA . 
TO GET US SO FAR IN DEBT WE CA N'T SUPPORT A MILITARY THEN WITH THE NATION DISARMED WHAT THE HADES ARE WE GOING TO DO .

SOME OF YOU WHO ARE MUSLIMS AND CAN PROVE IT . 
MAYBE YOU WILL NOT BE BEHEADED BUT THE REST YOU 'RE GONE .

The headline is FALSE , my post : First he did n't `` direct fire '' at both sides , he said : `` Both parties have within them members '' ... The first two words in Cristie 's statement make it absolutely clear that he 's directing fire at both sides . 
The reported is correct . 
Apparently you 've chosen to ignore that because you do n't like it ? 
Please take off your partisan blinders and see all of what Cristie said and not just choose the parts you want to see . 
For an example on the GOP side of the isle , you might consider the fact that none of them will acknowledge that tax cuts reduce revenue and therefore add to the deficit . 
When Cristie says they 're afraid to tell the truth because it 's unpopular , that 's one of the things he 's talking about . 
Just to be clear , I 'm not defending the Dems here . 
They do it too . 
January 28 , 2011 at 1:49 pm | Reply The US has been telling Mubarak for years he should make his country more Democratic , but he did n't listen to our advice and now his own people are trying to depose him . 
Sometimes people have to learn the hard way . 
January 28 , 2011 at 3:15 pm | Reply I agree with that ! 
I believe we do need to stop trying to pretend to police the world ! 
We never should 've started this hypocritical agenda , which bottomline is based primarily on greed and\/or acquiring something ! 
Why did n't you tell George W Bush not to pay any attention to IRAQ ? 
Oh yes , any time AMERICA has EVER interferred with another countrys ' affairs , you can rest assured that the main concern was about BIG BUSINESS ; owned by the greedy ! 
That 's been the main reason ; hidden under the cloak of FREEDOM !

This is what they 're waiting on and Obama desires . 
It is his aim to weaken us where we cant fight .

He is hitting the Military even though the boys are fighting for their lives . 
His wife big hipped Michele has already said as much . 
She was n't proud of America only the money to pay for her vacations . 
We do not help our allies then they will have no reason to come to our aid when the Muslims arabs come pouring into this country .

BUT YOU DO N'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE iRAQ WAR IS ALL ABOUT . 
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE iRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR TO GET A GRIP ON THIS SITUATION . 
THIS HAS BEEN COMING FOR YEARS . 
READ AND iIKNOW YOU DO THE BIBLE . . 
THE END OF DAYS THAT WE 'RE IN NOW IS LEADING US DIRECTLTY TOWARD WHAT REVELATIONS TELLS YOU . 
IRAQ WAS FURNISHED WITH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BY US THE UNITED STATES . 
WE KNOW HE HAD THEM . 
WHO HAS THEM NOW THE LORD KNOWS . 
BUT AS SOON AS WE GAVE THEM TO HUSSAIN HE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT A WHOLE KURD VILLAGE TO SEE HOW THEY WORKED . 
THE KURDS IS ARABIAN PEOPLE ALSO BUT NOT MUSLIMS . 
MUSLIMS MAIN GOAL IS TO DESTROY ALL INFIDELS AND HAS BEEN SINCE BIBICAL TIMES . 
YES I ALSO BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE HIT AFGHANISTAN FIRST WITH EVERYTHING WE HAD AND TAKEN BIN LADEN OUT . 
BUT OUR GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT TO STAND THE CHANCE OF HIS BEING TAKEN ALIVE BECAUSE THE REAL STORY OF OLLIE NORTH AND BIN LADEN WILL COME ABOUT . 
THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR WAS ALL ABOUT THE U.S. GETTING ARMS AND MUNITIONS PLUS MONEY IN TO BIN LADEN SO HE COULD FIGHT THE RUSSIANS WHILE WE WERE IN VIETNAM . 
WE CREATED BIN LADEN . 
THIS IS NOT PROPAGANDRA . 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE U.S. MISFIGURED AND ALL WE DID WAS CREATE A DEVIL IN BIN LADEN AND HUSSAIN . 
BOTH COUNTRIES MUST BE TAKEN BUT IN MY ESTIMATION THEY WILL NEVER BE CONQUERED . 
IT IS NOT IN THE BIBLE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN . 
BUT WE AS AMERICANS WILL FALL TREMBLING TO OUR KNEES BEFORE , OF ALL COUNTRIES RUSSIA COMES TO OUR AID AND HELPS TO TURN BACK THE ARAB NATIONS FOR THEY WILL HAVE CONQUERED EUROPE . 
I 'M GETTING INTO THE FUTURE HERE -LRB- BUT NOR REALLY FOR IT IS BEGINNING NOW . -RRB- 
EGYPT TELLS YOU THAT TODAY .

That usually stirs me up and makes me say stupid things . 
I voted for Obama so I do n't totally disagree with him . 
My problem is all his bailouts when he whould have just let them go bankrupt . 
I know it would have put people out of jobs . 
Better that than the U.S. go belly up . 
I do n't like his dealing with Red China who has caused more deaths to our American soldiers than any other country . 
I do n't like his opening relations with Cuba . 
The most oppressed people around are the Cubans . 
I do n't agree with his policy on Illegals . 
I have nothing against them I think he should tell the Mexican president you 're going to let these people come and your not going to charge them a fee as great as it would take for them to sneak into our country . 
That way they can become benefitting citizens of this country . 
I am sorry if I offended you . 
We are all carrying the same blood line . 
About slavery it was an atrocity that American bought the slaves . 
But slavery is and has being going on since forever . 
Think of the thousands of years the Christians were slaves . 
We all are a sad people if we are a party to that . 
Take my apologys for what some of the forefathers of this nation did . 
Thankfully my family was not a part of that . 
My forefathers came to Mass. then migrated to Texas after the war . 
They did not have slaves nor believed in it . 
They wore blue in the Civil War and my family has been connected with the military since each generation .

January 29 , 2011 at 1:39 pm | Reply Before mieiirsctdng your anger at the US , it might be time for the Arab world to take a look at itself and the leaders it has produced . 
Hafez Assad : In 1982 Assad slaughtered between 10,000 and 20,000 of its own citizens in Hama , Syria . 
We will never know the exact count because the press was kept away from Hama . . 
Also the Arab world seemed to be obsessed pinning direct guilt on Israel for the Sabra and Shatilla massacres committed by the Phalangists . 
He was only replaced by his son , whose power has not been tested . 
The US did not created that regimeSaddam Hussein : Gassed , shot , burned , tortured tens of thousands of Kurds and Shiite Muslims . 
Anyone who opposed him found an early graveThe Current Saudi monarchy that makes Iran seem like a liberal paradiseWe now can look at Lebanon and it faux Cedar Revolution . 
Hezbollah , a force greater that the Lebanese army is waiting the wings to seize powerLet 's look at Mubarak and his current regime . 
It really is a typical past Egyptian regimes under Soviet sponsored Nasser and Sadat . 
Maybe there were a few symbolic reforms . 
The US did not invent the current system , not did to prop it up . 
Mubarak comes for the same pedigree as the two previous leaders . 
As for the teeth necklace comment , that truly sickens me coming for someone who fails to see the demons within the Arab world . 
After decades of independence and collectively lots of resources , one would think that political stability could be established in te Arab world without oppression and bloodshed .

At times , my gift of discernment separates true and honest political complaints , from the ones who 've just read someone elses complaint ; jumped on the bandwagon , with a racist agenda , to attack him , COWARDLY , under the cloak of politics !

We have plenty of retarded people here in the U.S. that think for him and they have n't a clue to what is happening or would happen if he makes a wrong decision . 
Let us pray he makes all right ones . 
If he does n't it will not be the end of the world and he will not be the first to make a wrong move . 
Like I said before you 're right people would lose jobs . 
He wanted to avoid that . 
But with all the money borrowed from China scares me . 
Red China is not our friends and they will never be . 
Of course Obama knows that better than we . 
Let us let him run the country and let us do our part by not being so critical . 
You hang in there and do n't get too upset when a bonehead says something that will hurt your feeling just know that you are at peace with God and you are doing whats best for you . 
January 30 , 2011 at 2:48 am | Reply @USPatriots38 ; to acknowledge the fact that you were not an OBAMA hater , that you voted for him ; you just hate his bailouts , well , BUSH had them to leave the campaign to go back to WASHINGTON to sign a big one , remember ? 
There was pro and con about that one but BUSH signed it . 
That shows us all that BUSH must have thought it was best to try to save the nation through it 's banks ! 
The CEOs stole it ! 
OBAMA goes into office trying to save jobs by reissuing monies to banks and corps , all hades breaks loose ! 
January 29 , 2011 at 7:31 pm | Reply @USPatriot38 ; the way I see it , it was a double-edged sword for PRES OBAMA ! 
Had CONGRESS , not OBAMA , done like you said and let them go bankrupt ; he would n't have ever heard the end of that either ! 
` That B-K N -- R got in there and let them corporations and GM fall and now more people are without jobs ' ! 
` We knew he was trying to DESTROY AMERICA ' ! 
You see what I mean ? 
It seems to me that this AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT is needled , pushed and pulled whichever WAY he goes on everything ! 
What CAN he do right ! 
January 29 , 2011 at 7:56 pm | Reply When Obama receivced a call from the `` Egyptian President '' he was asking for money and a safe place to hid . 
Knowing Obama he said `` I 'm working on I 'll make some calls and I 'll get back to you '' . 
This is what is going on behind the scenes . 
As for the people who are tearing up Egypt Mobarik is waiting for Obama 's call . 
If you notice the people who are rioting in the streest of Egypt are all young people they are fed up with the way Mobarik has treating them . 
Mobarik thinks he 'll use the same old tactics he used before and they 'll work . 
He has found out that they are not working and does know what to do . 
So who does he call Obama who is his ATM machine . 
Obama and his band of `` Nt Wits '' are trying to find out who they can put in to replace Mobarik and create a Democracy . 
Let me give you an example : Look at who the United States put in charge in Iraqi that guy could n't run a `` Hot Dog Stand '' . 
What Obama should tell Mobarik is `` Pay us back all the `` Billions '' we gave you and we 'll get you out , if not your on your own . 
I think that 's a good deal . 
In Chicago that 's known as `` Pay to Play '' . 
I think that 's a good deal give the United States Tax Payer 's our money back and the United States will get Mobarik out . 
If not `` Happy Trails '' . 
January 30 , 2011 at 9:56 am | Reply @USPatriot38 ; Again thank you for your response . 
However , I myself , was not in the military , but as I mentioned earlier , my husband is a disabled USMC veteran of the VIETNAM WAR , 1969-1972 . 
He 's also very aware of the tendencies for bad intelligence and misread information to be sent down to them from military officials in WASHINGTON . 
After the Powell speech at the UN , he and several of his old war buddies were of an opinion that the war in IRAQ was an untimely one ; AFGHANISTAN should 've been the focus . 
January 30 , 2011 at 11:06 am | Reply USPatriot38 ; Oh , and I would like to thank you for your words of encouragement ; and yes my brother in CHRIST , I am at peace with GOD . 
However , I 'm sure HE is n't through with me yet ! 
My reason for even mentioning the IRAQ WAR is because I believe it played the biggest part in our deficit ! 
We started borrowing money from CHINA to sustain it all these years , not to mention all of the lives lost and DISABLED families ! 
OBAMA goes in and now they 're his wars , his BILLS , and he needs a magic wand , to fix it ! 
January 30 , 2011 at 11:33 am | Reply @USPatriot38 ; I want you to also know this , I LOVE MY SOLDIERS , MARINES , AIRMEN , and SEAMEN ! 
I have undescribable love , respect , honor , admiration , and pride for ALL of our US VETERANS ! 
Not to worry , I 'll always be behind my military 1000 % ! 
You take an oath to go off , take orders , fight and die for us back here at home , and our safety ! 
My BIG HURT is with ALL you give up in the name of patriotism , honor and loyalty to your country is ABUSED by the ` GREEDY ' under the guise of freedom and democracy !
