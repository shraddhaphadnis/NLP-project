WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- - The United States will review its aid to Egypt based on protests and the government 's response , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday . 
`` We will be reviewing our assistance posture based on events now and in the coming days , '' he told reporters . 
In a carefully worded press conference , Gibbs said that President Barack Obama has not spoken with Mubarak . 
When asked why the president had n't contacted the Egyptian leader , Gibbs said `` We are again , we 're monitoring a very fluid situation . '' 
Gibbs urged restraint and called for everyone involved to refrain from using violence . 
The White House is `` deeply concerned about the images and the events we see in Egypt today , '' he said . 
`` The situation should be addressed through concrete reforms . 
That 's what the people of Egypt demand . 
That 's what they deserve , '' said Gibbs . 
Another year , another Bush puppet dictator collapses and President Obama is left to clean up his predecessors mess in another country . 
Count this one as Bush 's third war that Obama must get us out of ! 
January 28 , 2011 04:59 pm at 4:59 pm | While you 're at it , why do n't you ask for a refund ... and , while you 're at it , review all the other foreign dictatorships you support . 
January 28 , 2011 04:59 pm at 4:59 pm | Great , we give Egypt $ 500 millions foreign aid yearly ???? and the people are hungry and forced to take this action of violence . 
What happened to the policies President Bush had for Egypt , did his policies not work ????? January 28 , 2011 05:01 pm at 5:01 pm | It 's concerning that Obama has failed to speak with Mubarek . 
I would expect a better response than `` We are again , we 're monitoring a very fluid situation . '' 
Obviously Biden 's downplay of the protests recently was a horrible assessment . 
It will be interesting to see what Obama does , if anything at all . 
Foreign relations was not one of his strong suits , which is supposedly why he attached Biden to the ticket . 
That was probably the worst decision he has made to date . 
January 28 , 2011 05:06 pm at 5:06 pm | @ New Age : Unlike Bush , Obama respects the SOVEREIGNTY of another Nation ! 
Let 's let Egypt take care of Egypt ! 
We have been BANKRUPTED already with the two Bush Wars ! 
January 28 , 2011 05:10 pm at 5:10 pm | @ grrace : `` while you are at it , review all the other foreign dictatorships you support '' ???????? What are you talking about ? 
The U.S. has supported Egypt for over 30 years ! 
Obama inherited all the foreign aid commitments , all the warped foreign relations ! 
You need to educate yourself . 
January 28 , 2011 05:12 pm at 5:12 pm | @ Inmyopinion : FYI we have been giving Egypt AID for many , many years ... ... including during the Bush years ! 
Amazing how ignorant the comments posted here are ! 
You , people need to educate yourselves before blaming Obama for everything ! 
January 28 , 2011 05:14 pm at 5:14 pm | America already MUSCLING Egypt with TRILLIONS of Dollars , MUCH HEAVY WEAPONS , shared practical knowledges to build ATOMIC and NUCLEAR BOMBS , MILITARY TRAININGS , free labor and high-technologies by building tall ASWAN and other DAMS , that has the capacities of TRILLIONS OF CUBIC METERS OF NILE WATER , etc. . 
Here , in America , our American Veterans and reserved ARMIES does n't have enough Money and good job to enjoy their life with their Families . 
President Bush ... Where were you trying to go with this ??? President Obama What ARE You going to do with this ? 
I am very worried about our national security ! 
January 28 , 2011 05:21 pm at 5:21 pm | It 's concerning that a so-called `` Independant '' instantly attacks Obama for an Egyptian matter exacerbated by the Bush Administration . 
January 28 , 2011 05:28 pm at 5:28 pm | Time-out . 
Egypt & their neighbor Israel have both been getting a ton of $ in U.S. foreign aid for DECADES . 
Some in Egypt and other Arab states consider Mubarek to be a puppet of America . 
It 's time that we end all foreign aid to the Mid-East ... yes that includes Israel . 
That way we will not be used in anti-America propaganda or used as a scapegoat for their own problems . 
January 28 , 2011 05:32 pm at 5:32 pm | Agreed Sgt Schultz . 
Reagan Bush and Bush have been feeding the monsters for too long . 
Their puppet regimes in Egypt and elsewhere were given money to battle their puppet regime in Israel . 
All that money to them for Halliburton Oil and a promise to buy US Arms President Obama knows we need to end this cycle and has been doing so . 
This is a situation they can take advantage of . 
January 28 , 2011 05:40 pm at 5:40 pm | If that means Obama wants to give millions MORE in aid to Egypt ... . 
January 28 , 2011 05:44 pm at 5:44 pm | Look in the dept of our way of life you can see Egypt staring at us . 
We can not and will not let that country fail . 
January 28 , 2011 05:48 pm at 5:48 pm | People complain about our democracy ?? They all need to shut up and be thankful that for 4 or 8 years you may be stuck with a bad President not 30 years of dictatorship !!!! I will say that the U.S. should provide NO MORE monetary support if Mubarak remains in power . 
This would be an INSTANT savings for the U.S. Get our military personnel out of that region of the world b\/c it is about to go CRAZY and we do not need to police them all . 
For those that believe in the bible ... Revelations is being revealed !!! GOD HAVE MERCY ON US ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! January 28 , 2011 05:49 pm at 5:49 pm | Some people here are starting to ask `` why '' . 
Continue to do that . 
After a while you will stop being a Republican and Democrat , and start resembling an American . 
Keep doing it and you will figure out that both parties of power have supported the same agenda over the many years . 
Keep asking `` why '' and you will read more about it , educate yourself , and maybe even have the guts to take your opinions beyond the `` comments '' section . 
America is all about distrust in the government , that is why we became a free country . 
Keep asking why America `` invests '' in the mideast , and realize it has very little to do with a political party . 
Read history to find out why . 
January 28 , 2011 05:51 pm at 5:51 pm | The Egyptians do not want to see a ruling and aging leader pass his leadership position to his son and continue their dynasty . 
It sounds just like North Korea and what just occured up there , the difference is they have a much tigher control on the people and society . 
The Egyptians have just about broke the camels back ... keep pushing ... the struggle is in your hands January 28 , 2011 05:59 pm at 5:59 pm | if you ask me , i do n't see why is the u.s funding anybody . 
January 28 , 2011 06:02 pm at 6:02 pm | Despite what that clown Axelrod claims , this administration has once again been at least a step behind during this crisis ! 
Furthermore , it is almost certain that this administration will mishandle this issue and end up backing the wrong horse in this race ... just like Carter during the Iranian Revolution ! 
January 28 , 2011 06:07 pm at 6:07 pm | Egypt failed when George Fail Bush supported it . 
The country will not fail because the people are rising up against the regime . 
January 28 , 2011 06:17 pm at 6:17 pm | Of course Pres. Mubarak did n't call President Obama first , he called Bush . 
President Obama was right in not calling Mubarak that would made it appear we were meddling and Mubarak would certainly use that excuse against the U.S. . 
When you 're weakened as Mubarak you look for any out other than yourself and he himself is their problem , not ours .
