The Egyptian military is probably the oldest , most well-functioning institution in Egypt . 
Egypt has had a long tradition of a very strong state . 
What we 're seeing is quite incredible because this is the oldest society in the Arab world with a deep and sophisticated culture with an authentic middle class . 
It is also the oldest state , with a very long tradition of administrative control and a very powerful military . 
Both sides are trying to test the other to see which will give . 
Any scenario , post-Mubarak , is going to involve the military because the military , in a sense , holds the country together . 
They will have to support whatever processes are put in place . 
My guess is that they 're going to want to play a role that is behind the scenes and not right in front .

Adding to the fun is that the chiefs of both museums are engaging in a spirited spat of trash talk that may belie the image many of us have about museum directors .

The theme this year is The New Reality . 
Last year s World Economic Forum in Davos focused on financial reform .

This year , a little explosion at a hotel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy s defense of the euro already have made headlines . 
A special ceremony is taking place at the Kennedy Space Center 's visitor complex this morning . 
Members of the NASA family and the public will gather to honor those who died aboard space shuttle Challenger . 
Twenty-five years ago the STS-51L crew boarded Challenger for a six-day flight . 
It was just after liftoff when things went wrong . 
Challenger was in the air for 73 seconds before the orbiter exploded . 
June Scobee Rodgers , the widow of Cmdr. Dick Scobee , will be one of many speakers honoring her husband and the members of his crew . 
This mission was to take the first teacher , Christa McAuliffe , up into space . 
Her widow , Steven McAuliffe , released a statement saying that his family finds it `` comforting and inspirational '' that people across the country continue to remember his wife and her Challenger crew members . 
The astronauts on the flight with Scobee and McAuliffe were pilot Michael Smith , mission specialists Judith Resnik , Ellison Onizuka and Ronald McNair ; and payload specialist Gregory Jarvis . 
According to investigators ' findings , the cause of the explosion was an O-ring that failed in one of the solid rocket boosters . 
Cold weather was cited as a contributing factor . 
The ceremony is taking place in front of The Space Mirror Memorial . 
This memorial lists the names of 24 U.S. astronauts who lost their lives while exploring space . 
That 's how long NASA 's space shuttle Challenger was in the air before an O-ring failure turned a routine mission into space into a tragedy on January 28 , 1986 . 
Twenty-five years after NASA 's first fatal in-flight accident , the memory of the Challenger disaster is still strong .

Editor 's note : John Zarrella was the CNN network correspondent on site when the 1986 Challenger shuttle disaster occurred . 
He recalls that day : When I went to the Kennedy Space Center on January 28 , 1986 , to cover the launch of the space shuttle Challenger , I was expecting it to be routine , like the launches I had covered in the past . 
The only thing different this time was the excitement that surrounded the first teacher-turned-astronaut , Christa McAuliffe . 
It was brutally cold , and the weather caused the launch to slip several times during the morning . 
Just before launch , I walked down to the countdown clock , as was tradition among the journalists , and waited for liftoff . 
I remember that typical winter clear-blue sky as Challenger took off .
