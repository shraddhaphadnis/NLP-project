2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . 
Egypt has had a long tradition of a very strong state . 
What we 're seeing is quite incredible because this is the oldest society in the Arab world with a deep and sophisticated culture with an authentic middle class . 
It is also the oldest state , with a very long tradition of administrative control and a very powerful military . 
Both sides are trying to test the other to see which will give . 
Any scenario , post-Mubarak , is going to involve the military because the military , in a sense , holds the country together . 
They will have to support whatever processes are put in place . 
My guess is that they 're going to want to play a role that is behind the scenes and not right in front .
