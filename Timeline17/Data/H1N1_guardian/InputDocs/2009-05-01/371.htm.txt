Friday 1 May 2009 22.47 BST It was a mates ' night out to celebrate a marriage . 
Eight days ago , Graeme Pacitti and friends from his amateur football team gathered to welcome the newly married man back from his honeymoon in Mexico . 
As Pacitti and the others sat around Iain Askham , they noticed he seemed tired . 
That was put down to jetlag but 48 hours later , Askham and his wife , Dawn , were swept into an isolation ward at Monklands hospital , 20 miles away in Airdrie , the first two British cases of swine flu . 
Today , Pacitti , the goalkeeper for their six-a-side team FC Mallard and a clerical worker at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , was confirmed as the first person to catch swine flu within the UK . 
The result left him feeling `` really disappointed '' , he said . 
`` Today I started to feel better than I have done all week . 
I 'm quite gutted . '' 
Confined at home with his mother Lesley , her boyfriend , and his younger brother Alan , he has been taking the anti-viral drug Tamiflu and nursing an aching head and throat . 
`` It started last Saturday when I started to feel like I had an upset stomach . 
From then my throat began to get sore , '' he said . 
`` The worst was when I started to get headaches and feel quite feverish . '' 
Yet earlier this week , Pacitti assumed he had avoided catching the virus . 
He had initially been cleared after he and two other members of that group out drinking with Askham and his best man , Neil Gardner , 26 , developed mild cold-like symptoms . 
But earlier this week , after Pacitti started to feel unwell , further tests confirmed he was carrying the influenza A-type virus the group which includes swine flu , known to the experts at H1N1 . 
But that kind of flu virus is rare in late spring . 
That immediately made it likely that Pacitti was the first case of onward transmission in Britain . 
It has already happened in the US , Canada , Spain and Germany .
