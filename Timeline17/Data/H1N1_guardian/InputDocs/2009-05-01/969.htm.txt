When Ros Atkins , a BBC radio presenter , came back to the UK after working in Mexico City , family and friends avoided him like he had , well , swine flu . 
After reading his account , we wondered about others who have visited Mexico recently and experienced the same sort of reaction upon returning home . 
If you have been to Mexico since the outbreak of the H1N1 virus , what was the reaction from loved ones ? 
Or have you changed your travel plans as a result of the disease ?
