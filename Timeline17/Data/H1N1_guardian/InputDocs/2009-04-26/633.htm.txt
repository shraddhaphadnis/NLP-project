The influenza strain that has struck Mexico and the United States involves , in many cases , a never-before-seen strain of the H1N1 virus . 
The flu virus is notorious for its ability to mutate and evolve new features that allows it to escape the immune defense systems of its victims . 
The appearance of new flu strains is therefore a perennial problem for doctors and scientists . 
And experts warned last night that it may be too late to contain the new outbreak , given how widespread the known cases are . 
If the confirmed deaths are the first signs of a pandemic , then cases are probably incubating around the world by now , said Dr Michael Osterholm , a flu expert at the University of Minnesota . 
In New York City , health officials say about 75 students at a Queens high school have fallen ill with flu-like symptoms and testing is under way to rule out that is the same strain of swine flu found in Mexico . 
No vaccine specifically protects against swine flu and it is unclear how much protection current generic vaccines might offer . 
A version genetically matched to the new swine flu virus has been created by the US Centres for Disease Control , said Dr Richard Besser , the agency 's acting director . 
However , it could take months to create enough supplies for mass vaccination programs - if governments decide vaccine production is necessary . 
Two drugs , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem effective against the new strain . 
Roche , the maker of Tamiflu , said it was prepared to immediately deploy a stockpile of the drug if requested . 
Both drugs must be taken early , within a few days of the onset of symptoms , to be most effective .
