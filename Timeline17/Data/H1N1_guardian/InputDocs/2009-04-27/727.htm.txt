Swine flu virus can be treated with antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza Is treatment available and does it work ? 
Testing has shown that the human swine influenza H1N1 can be treated with the antivirals oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- , according to the UK 's Health Protection Agency . 
The health secretary , Alan Johnson , said yesterday that Tamiflu had proved effective on patients in Mexico . 
Demand has historically been greatest for Tamiflu , which comes in tablet form , while Relenza must be inhaled . 
What do antiviral treatments do ? 
Drugs relieve some of the symptoms , reduce the potential for serious complications like pneumonia and cut the length of the illness by around a day . 
Crucially , they also reduce transmission of the virus from person to person . 
The government estimates that up to 750,000 people could die in the UK during a pandemic without antivirals . 
How much of these drugs do we have ? 
The NHS signed contracts earlier this year with pharmaceutical companies Roche , which makes Tamiflu , and GlaxoSmithKline , which makes Relenza , to double its store of antiviral drugs , bringing our total capacity to 33.5 million treatment courses . 
The government 's store would cover 50 % of the population everyone predicted to fall ill in the event of a pandemic . 
It says the UK is already widely recognized as one of the best prepared countries in the world . 
Previous flu pandemics have infected between 25 % and 35 % of the population . 
Scientists are working on developing a vaccine against the new strain . 
But reporters at a European commission briefing in Luxembourg were told that although the industry was working as fast as possible and new measures meant it could be on the market much quicker than a normal vaccine , the process could still take up to half a year .
