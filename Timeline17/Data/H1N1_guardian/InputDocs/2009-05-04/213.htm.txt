The head of the World Health Organisation , Margaret Chan , yesterday suggested the swine flu pandemic alert would eventually move to its highest level . 
But the woman in charge of the global fight against the H1N1 outbreak said a move to level six should not be taken as a cause for panic . 
`` Level six does not mean , in any way , that we are facing the end of the world . 
It is important to make this clear because -LRB- otherwise -RRB- when we announce level six it will cause unnecessary panic , '' she told Spain 's El Pa s newspaper . 
Officials from the United Nations and the WHO later insisted that there were no imminent plans to raise the alert level . 
But they agreed that going to the highest level could be an eventuality . 
Raising the alert level to six would mean that a global pandemic was in full effect . 
However , the officials emphasised that a pandemic did not necessarily mean the disease was particularly deadly . 
And in a video link with the UN , Chan appeared to attempt to allay fears , adding : `` We are not there yet . '' 
The Financial Times also reported that Chan , who recently raised the threat of a pandemic to level five , had suggested a move to level six was likely . 
She warned that the real blow might come if a second wave of cases swept across the globe at the start of the winter flu season . 
`` If it 's going to happen , it would be the biggest of all outbreaks the world has faced in the 21st century , '' she said . 
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , said : `` Let us remember that even if the WHO does declare phase six , a pandemic , that would be a statement about the geographic spread of the virus , not its severity . '' 
Spain remains the European country with the most cases of swine flu . 
By yesterday there were 54 reported cases , including four people who were infected in the country . 
The outbreak has raised concerns over its potential impact on tourism .
