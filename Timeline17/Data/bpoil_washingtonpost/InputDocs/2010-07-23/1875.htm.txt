Hearings focus on possible human factors in BP oil spill Friday , July 23 , 2010 ; 7:07 AM KENNER , LA. -- Before he died in the April conflagration aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , crew member Shane Roshto shared a dark assessment with his wife . 
`` From Day One he deemed this hole a well from hell , '' widow Natalie Roshto told an investigating panel Thursday . 
`` He said Mother Nature just does n't want to be drilled here . '' 
Mother Nature aside , the third day of the third round of hearings by a federal board meeting outside New Orleans focused on an array of human factors that may have contributed to one of the worst environmental disasters in history . 
The litany included overdue maintenance on critical equipment , a dire warning that went unnoticed by key personnel , and a series of decisions about drilling procedures that allegedly sacrificed safety to save money . 
The probe is being conducted by investigators from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -- the agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service . 
The day 's main witness was John Guide , a BP well team leader who oversaw drilling on the Macondo well from BP offices onshore . 
Guide was asked about an April 18 report -- two days before the disaster -- from contractor Halliburton concluding that the well had the potential for a severe gas flow problem . 
`` I did n't even know that that particular piece was in there , '' Guide said , adding that he never looked at that section of such reports . 
He said he and one of the BP leaders on the rig were focused on an attachment to the report dealing with a different topic -- how to cement the well . 
The warning , he said , was `` just part of '' a simulation . 
If he had known about the warning , `` we would have huddled up and discussed '' it , Guide said .
