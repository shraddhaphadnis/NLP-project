BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg attempted an earnest apology Wednesday for the worst environmental accident ever to befall America , but it will be remembered for only two words : Svanberg came with other BP executives to the White House , where he said President Obama made clear that he is `` frustrated because he cares about the small people . '' 
`` And we care about the small people , '' added Svanberg , who is Swedish . 
`` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care . 
But that is not the case indeed . 
We care about the small people . '' 
Just like that , a new slogan was born . 
It sardonically swept through cyberspace and landed in the gulf , where it was greeted with no more enthusiasm than the unrefined crude gushing from BP property . 
`` We 're not small people . 
We 're human beings . 
They 're no greater than us . 
We do n't bow down to them . 
We do n't pray to them , '' said Justin Taffinder of New Orleans . 
`` Purely a translation matter , '' e-mailed BP spokesman Scott Dean . 
And later Wednesday , Svanberg apologized for his apology : `` I spoke clumsily this afternoon , and for that , I am very sorry . '' 
BP 's European executives have consistently struggled to strike the right tone in response to the oil spill . 
Svanberg was the guy who was supposed to demonstrate all the humility that Tony Hayward , the company 's chief executive , ca n't quite muster . 
Early on , Hayward outraged Gulf Coast residents and officials when he pledged to honor `` all legitimate claims , '' then scoffed , when asked for examples of illegitimate claims : `` I could give you lots of examples . 
This is America -- come on . 
We 're going to have lots of illegitimate claims . 
We all know that . '' 
Later , Hayward complained : `` There 's no one who wants this over more than I do . 
I would like my life back . '' 
BP officials have also caught flak for using the word `` scheme '' -- British parlance for a large institutional plan but a word more akin to `` scam '' here -- when talking about a fund to pay claims . 
Here 's a tip : In America , when we say `` put a lid on it , '' we mean all of it . ''
