Standing outside BP 's Houston offices Thursday , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that the company 's `` life is very much on the line here . '' 
BP 's financial wounds from April 20 drilling-rig explosion might be serious , but they probably wo n't be fatal . 
One analyst report , issued by Citigroup , even declared in its title , `` Reaction to the Gulf of Mexico oil leak is a buying opportunity . '' 
Even though most investors have soured on BP , driving down its stock price by 19 percent and wiping out $ 36.7 billion of its market value since the explosion , the business remains a behemoth . 
The company has a market value of $ 152.6 billion , bolstered by a global marketing network , a lucrative oil venture in Russia , a promising contract to boost production in a giant Iraqi field and scores of other large interests . 
It remains the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico . 
Measured by revenue or assets , it is among the world 's five largest companies . 
Citigroup analysts said stockholders ' reactions seem `` disproportionate to the likely costs to the company . '' 
It noted that punitive damages against Exxon for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil-tanker spill were originally set at $ 5 billion in 1994 but were reduced on appeal . 
The company agreed last year to pay less than $ 1 billion , including interest . 
For now , at least , BP 's prodigious costs combating the oil spill in the Gulf are outweighed by prodigious profits . 
On Monday , BP said it spent $ 350 million in the first 20 days of the spill response , about $ 17.5 million a day . 
It has paid 295 of the 4,700 claims received , for a total of $ 3.5 million . 
By contrast , in the first quarter of the year , the London-based oil giant 's profits averaged $ 93 million a day . 
The amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico has been estimated at 5,000 to 25,000 barrels a day . 
In the first quarter , BP produced 2.5 million barrels of crude oil a day worldwide -- and it received $ 71.86 for every barrel . 
BP has strong borrowing capacity , too . 
Analysts say it could get as much as $ 20 billion without exceeding its debt targets . 
`` Even a pretty large digging into the pockets would be within our capacity to handle , '' said Andrew Gowers , a BP spokesman . 
The company does , however , have large needs -- with a $ 20 billion capital spending plan for this year and $ 8.4 billion needed for acquisitions , mainly of assets from Devon Energy . 
Now , cleanup costs must be added . 
Relief wells being drilled to intercept the damaged one could cost more than $ 100 million each . 
Scores of lawsuits have been filed . 
Legislation passed in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez accident makes BP and its partners responsible for cleanup costs and up to $ 75 million in damages . 
BP officials said Monday that they expect to exceed that . 
`` A $ 75 million liability is not where our head is at this moment , '' said David Nagel , an executive vice president . 
On Friday , Standard & Poor 's affirmed BP 's credit rating but revised its outlook to `` Negative '' from `` Stable . '' 
`` Provided BP can stem the well and clean the spill within a reasonable time , the company has adequate liquidity and financial headroom to meet immediate costs , '' said a report by S&P credit analyst Simon Redmond . 
`` However , it is still too early to estimate with any degree of confidence the full future impact on BP from the spill . '' 
BP will survive , analysts say , but damage caused by the rig disaster that killed 11 workers was still huge . 
Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer , said the accident was `` a major disaster with catastrophic implications not only for the companies involved , but also for the offshore oil industry and the economies of the Gulf Coast . '' ''
