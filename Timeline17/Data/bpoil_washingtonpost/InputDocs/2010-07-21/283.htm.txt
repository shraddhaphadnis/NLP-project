-LRB- AP Photo\/Patrick Semansky -RRB- -LRB- Patrick Semansky - AP -RRB- Wednesday , July 21 , 2010 ; 6:11 PM With weather conditions deteriorating in the eastern Caribbean , BP stopped work Wednesday on efforts to finally kill its blown-out well and installed a plug in the relief well as protection if the seas get rough . 
Company senior vice president Kent Wells said that while boats and crew remain at the Macondo site , work on the relief well was stopped in the morning and evolving plans for an additional effort to seal the well from above were put on hold . 
`` We could have a tropical storm at Macondo , '' Wells said , `` and we have to be able to get out of the way . 
We have to watch the weather very , very carefully and adjust plans accordingly . '' 
The plug was installed about 300 feet below the sea floor , beneath the blowout preventer of the relief well . 
Forecasters predict the storm system will most likely move into the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend , although in a weakened condition . 
Right now , it has a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical depression or storm within the next 48 hours . 
If it does head towards the Gulf Coast , the long-feared possibility arises of increased oil pollution ashore and in the marshes . 
The Shell Oil Company announced Wednesday that it was preparing to take all non-essential personnel off its platforms and rigs in the eastern Gulf as a precaution . 
Spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh said the move was triggered by the possibility of bad weather rather than any clear threat . 
BP spokesman Daren Bodo said his company was watching the weather but had not yet decided on any evacuation . 
If the weather forces workers to leave the leak site , the final sealing of the well could be delayed 10 to 14 days , National Incident Commander Thad Allen said Wednesday . 
Since a new containment cap was installed last week , the well has been plugged and the oil and gas geyser controlled . 
BP officials said they were confident the well as currently configured would hold up during a storm . 
Earlier in the day , Allen also said that efforts to collect oil from the water surface appear to be successful . 
`` We 're really having to search for the oil in some cases , '' he said . 
`` We 've had skimmers out there on the wellhead site for a number of days now , as many as 50 a day . '' 
In Washington , the House passed legislation Wednesday by voice vote that would increase funding for research and development of new oil cleanup methods and technologies from $ 22 million to $ 48 million . 
A second bill promotes research on devices designed to prevent accidents and better shut off wells if they occur .
