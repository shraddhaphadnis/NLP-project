Friday , June 18 , 2010 ; 3:17 PM LONDON -- British newspapers and commenters turned on President Obama , members of Congress and Americans in general Friday as they denounced the treatment of BP chief executive Tony Hayward by a House investigative panel . 
Responding to what they variously described as a `` savage grilling , '' a hypocritical spectacle and even a `` Stalinist show trial , '' tabloids bristled at perceived anti-British sentiment in Thursday 's hearing on the BP oil spill disaster by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce . 
British politicians , for their part , generally steered clear of the controversy . 
But one senior member of Prime Minister David Cameron 's government expressed sympathy for the Obama administration . 
Chris Huhne , secretary of state for energy and climate change , said : `` We have to put this in the context of the environmental crisis that Barack Obama is facing in the Gulf of Mexico . '' 
Speaking live on the BBC 's current affairs show `` Question Time , '' Huhne took a swipe at tabloids lamenting the alleged anti-British rhetoric coming out of Washington . 
`` I recognize there is , particularly in parts of the tabloid press , a strong lobby which would like us to re-fight the American War of Independence , '' he said . 
While `` some of the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- rhetoric is clearly over the top , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague `` did n't find it was anti-British and reported back on that , '' Huhne said . 
`` But it is clearly anti-BP and anti-big oil for the understandable reasons that this is an environmental catastrophe which has cost lives and livelihoods . '' 
Cameron came to BP 's defense Thursday during a visit to Brussels , calling the British oil giant `` an important multinational company '' that is not only vital to Britain but is `` also important , I would argue , to the United States . '' 
He said BP `` recognizes that it has huge obligations and it will have to spend a huge amount of money '' to contain and plug its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , clean up the spill and pay appropriate compensation . 
But tabloids and their readers lashed out over what they described as the six-hour interrogation of Hayward by grandstanding congressmen . 
London 's Daily Mail said Hayward , a 53-year-old British geologist who has been chief executive of BP for three years , `` was subjected to a grilling so savage yesterday that it was more like ancient Rome than Capitol Hill . '' 
It said the `` hapless boss and his company '' were treated like `` Public Enemy No. 1 . '' 
Hayward `` was always going to get a caning from U.S. congressmen playing to the gallery , '' the Daily Express said in an editorial . 
`` Cheap lines about taking his ` golden parachute back to England ' revealed the anti-British prejudice that was at work . '' 
The editorial continued : `` The insatiable demand for oil of the American lifestyle is what has prompted the need for so much inherently risky deep-water drilling . 
Until the Americans take action to curtail this demand then their complaints amount to nothing more than the squealing of hypocrites . '' 
A news story in the paper said Thursday 's hearing `` took on the style of a Stalinist show trial . '' 
It quoted Richard Branson , the British magnate who chairs the Virgin Group , as accusing Obama of `` unseemly behavior '' for repeatedly `` kicking a company while it was on its knees . '' 
Branson said BP `` deserves to be criticized , '' but that so do U.S. government regulators . 
The Sun joined the indignant reporting . 
The paper 's business editor wrote that the hearing had a `` distasteful anti-British feel . '' 
British actress Helen Mirren also took some flak in the British press Friday for criticizing BP on the `` Late Show '' with David Letterman . 
Writing in the Daily Express , columnist James Delingpole said Mirren 's `` treachery '' would not be easily forgiven . 
`` She has ganged up with President Obama in his cheaply xenophobic and quite appallingly unfair campaign to make out that the BP oil spill is somehow Britain 's fault , '' he said . 
Daily Mail columnist Philip Norman agreed : `` One might have thought that a Dame of the British Empire who has portrayed the Queen -LRB- and , in many American eyes , is almost inseparable from her -RRB- would try in some graceful , light-hearted way to counteract the decidedly anti-British rhetoric coming from a grandstanding President Obama . '' 
Online commenters weighed in with more criticism . 
`` So these are the rulers of the most powerful nation on earth , '' a `` Mr. Grimsdale '' wrote on the Daily Mail 's Web site . 
`` I think the rest of us should be worried , very worried by this bunch of ignorant potato heads with their fingers on the nuclear button . '' 
On the Sun 's Web site , a writer named `` dispondant '' complained : `` It was an accident for god 's sake . 
Do the yanks think it was done on purpose ... Obama needs to back off & let BP get on with the job in hand they dont need a prat of a president posturing about & getting in the way . '' 
Commenter `` littlesod '' wrote on the same site : `` so when are the Americans gonna say sorry for IRAQ ?? that was a LIE based only on OIL and a foothold in the Arabic region . 
but then again the US think they rule the world ... '' News , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .
