The much-anticipated congressional hearing Thursday on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill came down to a single word : Sorry . 
In a room packed with cameras and spectators , BP chief executive Tony Hayward said , `` I am deeply sorry '' for the lost lives and environmental damage from his company 's doomed offshore rig . 
But the British businessman 's apology before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was upstaged by another one . 
Rep. Joe Barton -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- 
apologized to BP , saying the deal made at the White House Wednesday to set up an escrow fund to cover oil-spill damages and claims amounted to a `` $ 20 billion shakedown . '' 
While a subdued Hayward went on to anger committee members by deflecting their questions , Barton riled up a wider audience across the political spectrum . 
Then , late in the afternoon , he apologized for his apology after party leaders threatened to oust him from his position as ranking Republican on the committee . 
Barton prompted the uproar with his opening statement at the hearing . 
`` I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday , '' he said . 
`` I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown . '' 
He said the escrow fund , which will be administered by the independent arbitrator Kenneth Feinberg , is a `` slush fund '' with `` no legal standing . '' 
Barton said BP should be pursued through the legal system . 
`` I apologize , '' he said to Hayward , who sat alone at the witness table , surrounded by two dozen photographers . 
`` I do not want to live in a country where anytime a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong is subject to some sort of political pressure that is , again , in my words , amounts to a shakedown . 
So I apologize . '' 
Condemnations came from fellow committee members , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , environmental groups and the liberal Center for American Progress . 
Vice President Biden said Barton 's comments were `` incredibly insensitive , incredibly out of touch . '' 
`` There 's no shakedown , '' Biden said angrily . 
`` It 's insisting on responsible conduct and a responsible response to something they caused . '' 
Republicans were no more supportive . 
House GOP leaders John A. Boehner -LRB- Ohio -RRB- , Eric Cantor -LRB- Va. -RRB- and Mike Pence -LRB- Ind. -RRB- all distanced themselves from Barton . 
`` Congressman Barton 's statements this morning were wrong , '' they said in a statement . 
`` BP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of $ 20 billion for that purpose . ''
