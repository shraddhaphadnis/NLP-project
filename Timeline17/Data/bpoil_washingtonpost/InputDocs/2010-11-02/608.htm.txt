In this waterfront city , where many lost their livelihoods to the summer of oil , a mixture of relief and melancholy greeted the news Tuesday . 
A financially healthy BP means jobs and compensation , but residents still reeling from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history are waiting for some good news of their own . 
BP said that costs related to the April 20 oil spill dragged down its third-quarter profit by more than 60 percent . 
The London-based company earned $ 1.79 billion from July through September , compared with $ 5.3 billion a year earlier . 
But the fact that BP returned to profits at all , coming after a loss of $ 17.2 billion in the second quarter , indicated the company 's operations remain solid despite the spill . 
`` That 's real good news they 're making money because at least we know they have the ability to pay us over a long period of time because we 've still got a lot of problems , '' said shrimp processor Rudy Lesso , whose Biloxi , Miss. business is down about 25 percent because much of the public is still afraid to eat Gulf seafood . 
BP has set up a $ 20 billion compensation fund to pay victims of the oil spill , cutting roughly $ 1.7 billion in checks so far . 
But the process has been slow and cumbersome for struggling Gulf coast residents . 
BP 's third-quarter performance fell well short of the industry norm . 
All the other major oil companies , except Chevron , have reported stronger third quarter profits thanks to higher oil and gas prices . 
The company 's $ 40 billion estimate for its overall spill response was $ 7.7 billion higher than its previous estimate provided during its second-quarter results released this summer , largely due to unanticipated additional expenses . 
The company had already spent $ 11.2 billion responding to the spill by the end of September . 
None of that , however , kept BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley from delivering a rosy prognosis . 
`` What I can report today is that BP is now in recovery mode , '' Dudley said Tuesday from London . 
At one point he talked about how the situation looks without the spill - an unthinkable leap for Gulf residents . 
`` Putting aside the incident ... the BP group as a whole delivered a strong business performance throughout the quarter in terms of both financial and safety performance , '' he added . 
Ewell Smith , head of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board , said people forget that oil and fishing have for decades `` worked side by side '' in the Gulf region .
