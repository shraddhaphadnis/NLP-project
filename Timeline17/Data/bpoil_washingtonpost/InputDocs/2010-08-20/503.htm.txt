Academic scientists are challenging the Obama administration 's assertion that most of BP 's oil in the Gulf of Mexico is either gone or rapidly disappearing -- with one group Thursday announcing the discovery of a 22-mile `` plume '' of oil that shows little sign of vanishing . 
The news was what is happening -- or not happening -- to it . 
The scientists said that when they studied it , they saw little evidence that the oil was being rapidly consumed by the gulf 's petroleum-eating microbes . 
The plume was in a deep , cold region where microbes tend to work slowly . 
`` Our data would predict that the plume would still be there now , '' said Benjamin Van Mooy , a Woods Hole researcher . 
`` We remain confident in our assessment , '' she said . 
The Woods Hole research , published in the peer-reviewed journal Science , provided one of the most detailed pictures yet of what this oil is doing under the surface . 
The scientists said that , using a robot submarine that zigzagged across the deep gulf , they found a plume of oil droplets that was as tall as a 65-story building and more than a mile wide . 
The plume , whose droplets were so small that the water appeared clear , extended off to the southwest of the well , 3,600 feet deep .
