HOUSTON -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Sunday that `` I am angry and I am frustrated '' that BP has not been able to seal its blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . 
`` We are 33 days into this effort , and deadline after deadline has been missed , '' he told reporters after visiting BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston . 
`` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately . '' 
Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , who is leading the federal response to the spill , acknowledged Sunday that the government is being forced to rely on BP and the private oil sector to try to plug the gusher . 
At the same time , BP said the containment method it was attempting on the seafloor was capturing much less of the leaking oil than three days ago . 
BP has deployed a long suction tube to the larger of two leaks from the well , but a BP spokesman said Sunday that this captured only 1,360 barrels of oil over the 24 hours to midnight Saturday . 
The flow has been declining from the 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- per day the company had said the tube was siphoning three days ago . 
BP engineers are now preparing a `` top kill , '' pumping heavy fluids into the well to try to shut it off , an operation to begin late Tuesday or early Wednesday , its managing director , Bob Dudley , told CNN . ''
