BP 's internal investigation of the Gulf Coast oil spill points to a series of equipment failures , mistakes and missed warning signs that led to the blowout and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , according to lawmakers briefed by the company . 
BP 's investigation , while incomplete , highlights a series of abnormal indicators -- about pipeline pressure and the flow of drilling fluids in the five hours before the explosion -- that should have been `` warning signs '' of trouble , according to a memo summarizing BP 's report . 
In one case , BP 's investigator told lawmakers that a `` fundamental mistake may have been made despite '' an indicator of a very large abnormality . 
BP also said it had concerns about the cementing job in the well , saying that one procedure had to be attempted nine times , which might have indicated `` contamination of the cement . '' 
In addition , lawmakers said , `` the BP investigation has also raised concerns about the maintenance history , modification , inspection , and testing of '' the blowout preventer . 
The account of BP 's investigation was contained in a House Energy and Commerce Committee memorandum . 
`` In addition , key questions exist about whether proper procedures were followed for critical activities throughout the day , '' the memorandum said . 
These mostly had to do with the management of drilling mud , which is used as a counterweight to oil and gas pressure pushing up from below . 
Once the blowout began , all the systems in place to prevent disaster broke down in serial fashion , the memorandum said , `` including the failure of its emergency disconnect system -LRB- EDS -RRB- , the failure of its automated mode function or deadman switch , the failure of the -LRB- blowout preventer 's -RRB- shearing functions , and the failure of the remote operated vehicle interventions .
