An attempt to use a mile-long tube to capture most of the oil gushing from a well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico failed on the first try , but technicians were working Saturday night to put the pipe in place , BP officials said . 
The `` riser insertion '' tactic , which gained support from BP engineers only in recent days , is akin to inserting one straw into another straw . 
The goal is to contain the oil in the main riser pipe before it reaches open water , where natural gas quickly combines with the water to form slushy methane hydrates that have complicated previous attempts to contain the leak . 
But the effort ran into mechanical trouble on the first stab , BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said . 
Giving few details , he said there was a problem connecting a 5,000-foot string of pipe to the `` tool '' being inserted into the damaged pipe . 
The tool was retrieved by a surface ship and an adjustment was made , Suttles said . 
Meanwhile , the Associated Press reported that another BP oil rig , the Atlantis , has operated in the gulf with incomplete and inaccurate engineering documents , a deficiency that prompted one BP official to warn could `` lead to catastrophic operator error . '' 
The allegations , made by a whistleblower , were `` substantiated '' in a report by an independent firm hired by BP . 
Also Saturday , BP resumed the spraying at depth of chemical dispersants , which break the oil into smaller pieces . ''
