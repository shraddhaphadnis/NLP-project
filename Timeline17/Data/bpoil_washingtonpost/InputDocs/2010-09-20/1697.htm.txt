Monday , September 20 , 2010 ; 10:47 PM BP said Monday that it would join the oil spill response group formed over the summer by Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips and Chevron . 
The other four companies said they would spend $ 1 billion to fabricate equipment and train teams that could be deployed in the event of a future spill in the Gulf of Mexico . 
They took out full-page ads in newspapers last week promoting their effort . 
BP said it would make its underwater well containment equipment and technical personnel available to the group , called the Marine Well Containment Co. , which will be operated by Exxon Mobil . 
BP arranged for the fabrication of containment devices only after its Macondo well began gushing oil into the gulf , after its Deepwater Horizon rig blew out on April 20 . 
The new response organization would have equipment on standby .
