-LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , 45 , gave his first speech on Wednesday since anti-government protesters took to the streets nearly two weeks ago . 
Here are some key facts about Assad : -- The world welcomed the British-trained eye doctor in 2000 as a potential pioneer of reform in autocratic Syria . 
-- The soft-spoken Assad took office after the death of his father , Hafez al-Assad , who brooked no dissent and refused to bend in the Arab-Israeli conflict for 30 years . 
-- Assad did appoint a cabinet at the end of 2001 packed with Western-trained technocrats in economic portfolios charged with developing a modern financial system to draw in foreign investors . 
-- The most visible result was legislation to ease financial restrictions and establish private banks . 
-- In 2003 , Assad reshuffled the cabinet citing disappointment with the pace of reform . 
He made more changes in 2004 . 
-- In 2007 Assad won a referendum that gave him a second seven-year term as president . 
The poll was considered by opponents , critics and the United States to be a sham . 
-- He has said he is willing to resume peace talks with Israel , insisting on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights occupied in 1967 , while continuing to position Syria as a self-declared champion of Arab resistance to the Jewish state . 
-- Under Assad , Syria has been Iran 's closest Arab ally , a major force in Lebanon , and a supporter of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups . 
-- The Baath Party , which seized power nearly 50 years ago , has governed under emergency laws and banned all opposition . 
Other grievances against authorities include the dominance of Assad 's minority Alawites over the Sunni Muslim majority , corruption , economic hardship and a rising cost of living . 
-- On Tuesday , Assad mobilized thousands of Syrian supporters in rallies across the country and also accepted the resignation of his government to try to deflect the challenge to his rule . 
\* HARIRI KILLING IN LEBANON : -- Since 2005 , when Washington withdrew its ambassador to Damascus after the assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri , Assad has engineered a rapprochement with the West but maintained a hard line against criticism at home . 
-- The United States resumed full diplomatic relations with Syria last January . 
However , tensions have grown again over neighboring Lebanon , where Damascus ally Hezbollah has gained the upper hand in a political crisis . 
-- Assad has always said that Damascus had no role in the blast which killed Hariri , but was forced to withdraw Syrian troops from Lebanon in April 2005 under global and Lebanese pressure . 
-- Hezbollah-backed Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati is trying to form a government after the Shi'ite group and its allies toppled Saad al-Hariri over his refusal to cut links with a U.N.-backed court investigating the killing of his father . 
-- Assad has called for a national unity government in Lebanon , saying that `` if you have one side taking over the other side , this means a conflict '' which may lead to civil war . 
-- Assad has said Lebanon 's government should reject any tribunal indictment . 
The tribunal issued a secret indictment in January 2011 which is likely to accuse Hezbollah members of involvement in the killing . 
Hezbollah has denied any role and says Mikati 's new government must end funding and withdraw Lebanese judges from the court . 
\* LIFE DETAILS : -- Bashar al-Assad , born in the Syrian capital , Damascus , in September 1965 , studied medicine at the University of Damascus and graduated as a general practitioner in 1988 . 
-- He then trained to become an ophthalmologist at a Damascus military hospital and in 1992 moved to London to continue his studies . 
-- In 1994 his older brother , Basil , who had been designated his father 's heir apparent , was killed in a car crash , and Bashar returned to Syria to take his brother 's place .
