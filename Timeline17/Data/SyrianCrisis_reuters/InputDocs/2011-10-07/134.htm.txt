\* Budget offers help for poor ahead of expected 2012 election \* Infrastructure spending to be increased to spur domestic demand \* Subsidy bill modestly lower \* 2011 GDP growth estimate trimmed to 5.0-5 .5 percent -LRB- Recasts with budget measures , adds comments -RRB- By Razak Ahmad and Min Hun Fong KUALA LUMPUR , Oct 7 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Malaysia said on Friday it planned to boost infrastructure and consumer spending to cushion the impact of the global economic downturn and bolster confidence in the run-up to an expected general election in early 2012 . 
Prime Minister Najib Razak also handed out cash payments to the poor , raised civil servants ' pay and opened up 17 service subsectors to foreign investors , with domestic demand targeted to be the key driver of the economy as a possible global recession clouds the outlook . 
`` Global developments would certainly have a direct impact on the Malaysian economy , '' Najib , who is also Finance Minister , said as he presented the 2012 budget in parliament . 
`` With these developments the government will put in place measures to stimulate domestic economic activities , in particular public and private investments . '' 
The government also allocated 2 billion ringgit of infrastructure projects for bumiputras , most of whom are ethnic Malays . 
It offered tax breaks for Islamic bond issuance , raised civil servant pensions and announced that it would list the global arm of its plantation group FELDA . 
Najib forecast that the economy would grow 5-6 percent in 2012 , while the fiscal deficit would fall further on the strength of robust domestic demand and commodities exports . 
Reflecting the downdraft on Asia from the slowdown in the United States and Europe , the government trimmed its 2011 economic growth target to 5.0-5 .5 percent from 5.0-6 .0 percent earlier . 
Its fiscal deficit will shrink further to 4.7 percent of gross domestic product next year from 5.4 percent in 2011 as it reduces development spending , confirming an earlier Reuters report . 
-LRB- ID : Analysts said the 2012 spending plan was tailored to woo voters , particularly the majority ethnic Malays whose support is split between Najib and the opposition . 
`` This a populist budget , he is trying to be popular with everyone , give goodies here and there so everyone wo n't do too badly , '' said James Chin , a political analyst at Monash University in Malaysia . 
`` What is surprising is the allocation to bumiputras . 
This was what Malay rights groups have been clamouring for but it 's a smaller allocation as they asked for 30 percent of the project . 
He is definitely trying to shore up ethnic Malay support . '' 
Najib is widely expected to call for a general election in early 2012 , although one is n't due until 2013 , to prevent further political fallout from the weakening global economy . 
The stock market ended 0.5 percent higher at 1,400.05 points while the budget was being announced .

But most economists thought the growth and deficit targets were too optimistic , given the weak global outlook . 
`` The last statement from -LRB- the central bank -RRB- Bank Negara was a bit more cautious , highlighting more the downside risks , whereas what I 've seen so far in terms of the forecasts and the general statement , is the government still seems fairly upbeat , '' said Hak Bin Chua , an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch . 
`` So there seems to be a slight disconnect ... are these sort of targets or are these really realistic projections ? '' 
Malaysia 's economic growth accelerated to a decade-high 7.2 percent in 2010 , and is officially expected to be at least 5 percent this year , though annual growth moderated to 4.0 percent in the second quarter of 2011 . 
Last month , the Asian Development Bank said it had reduced its forecast for Malaysia 's 2011 GDP growth to 4.8 percent from 5.3 percent previously as global uncertainties grow , and trimmed its 2012 forecast to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent . 
The government said net domestic borrowings are expected to total 43.6 billion ringgit versus 45.1 billion ringgit in 2011 . 
Government revenue will be up 1.9 percent at 186.9 billion ringgit -LRB- $ 59 billion -RRB- in 2012 from a year ago , thanks to better tax earnings . 
Subsidy spending on staples such as fuel , sugar and flour are expected to total 33.2 billion ringgit next year , versus 32.8 billion ringgit in 2011 . 
The government said inflation stood at 3.1 percent for the January-August period this year but did not give a forecast for 2012 . 
Domestic demand will expand 7.6 percent in 2012 , versus 8.1 percent this year . 
Exports , which accounted for about 89 percent of the Malaysian economy last year , are targeted to rise 6.0 percent next year , slowing slightly from the projected 6.7 percent this year . 
Import growth will moderate to 7.0 percent next year from 7.5 percent this year .
