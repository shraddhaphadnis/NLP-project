Syrian TV shows footage of an iftar meal in Damascus hosted by beleaguered president Bashar al-Assad for Islamic leaders . 
Iftar marks the end of the fasting day during the holy month of Ramadan . 
In an address to the assembled scholars and leaders , Assad said Ramadan was a time for doing good deeds . 
He blamed ` morals ' in Syrian society for the on-going crisis , adding that the army was protecting the nation . 
But activists say that Syrian forces raided an eastern tribal region for a second day on Thursday , extending the crack-down on pro-democracy protests . 
Video footage posted on a social media website overnight - which Reuters is unable to independently verify - shows yet more large protests across Syria . 
At this funeral purportedly in Damascus for a man killed in the protests , the crowd chants : `` The one who kills his own people is a traitor '' .
