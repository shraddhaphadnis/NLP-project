GENEVA | Fri May 27 , 2011 2:20 pm BST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fighting in Misrata killed an estimated 12 people a day and wounded about 70 in the Libyan city 's six operating hospitals , the World Health Organisation said on Friday . 
The number killed or injured has decreased significantly over the past week as fighting has eased , the WHO said , but said the health situation remained critical . 
A Reuters reporter in Misrata said rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi were engaged in heavy fighting on the city 's western outskirts on Friday . 
After a mission involving several U.N. agencies to Misrata , WHO media officer Tarik Jasarevic said medical records had been lost or moved during the fighting , so he could give only estimated figures . 
`` What our team found is that from six operating hospitals , there were on average 12 deaths and 70 injuries per day during the fighting , '' he said . 
`` These numbers have been going down in the last week . '' 
He warned further deaths could be caused by a lack of specialist medical staff and drugs , including antibiotics , which raises the threat of drug-resistant infection , especially in intensive care units . 
Misrata is the biggest rebel stronghold in the west of the country and has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in Libya 's three-month-old conflict . 
Rebels have pushed Gaddafi 's forces out of the center of the city but are still attacking from positions on the outskirts .
