PARIS | Thu Mar 24 , 2011 6:11 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - France urged Syria on Thursday to open up to dialogue and democratic change , after Syrian forces killed six people in an attack on protesters and opened fire on hundreds of youths marching in solidarity . 
In all , 14 civilians have been killed by Syrian forces in six days of demonstrations for political freedom and an end to corruption , in a protest movement spreading across the Arab world since a popular uprising in Tunisia late last year . 
`` We urge Syria to listen to the voice of dialogue and of democracy , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters . 
`` A great change is under way . 
For a long time , France 's Arab policy aimed for stability . 
Today , Arab policy is to listen to the aspirations of the people and that applies to Syria , which must take on board this widespread movement . '' 
France , the former colonial ruler of Tunisia and Syria , has repeatedly condemned what it says is excessive force being used in Syria and has called for an investigation into civilian deaths and the release of detained protesters . 
France 's relations with Syria were strained by the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri , where initial U.N. reports implicated Syrian and Lebanese security agencies but Damascus denied any involvement . 
Since 2008 , Paris has sought to improve ties with Damascus .
