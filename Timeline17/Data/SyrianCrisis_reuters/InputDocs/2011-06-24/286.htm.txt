Fri Jun 24 , 2011 4:41 pm BST \* SPR oil sale terms now favor U.S. vessels to move crude \* US shipping group said govt was helping foreign workers WASHINGTON , June 24 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Obama administration on Friday backtracked on its plan to make it easier for foreign-based ships to move the millions of barrels of emergency crude oil the government hopes to sell to ease expected tight global supply . 
Under the administration 's plans announced on Thursday to sell 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , the government said it would provide an automatic waiver from the Jones Act , a federal law that prevents foreign ships from transporting U.S. goods , including crude oil , between American ports . 
The Jones Act , created to support jobs in the U.S. maritime industry , requires that goods moved between U.S. ports be carried by ships built in the United States , owned by Americans and have U.S. crews . 
The administration reversed its decision on Friday following criticism from the U.S. maritime sector . 
`` We are dumbfounded by President Obama 's decision to disregard the American maritime industry , which has sufficient capacity to complete this work , '' the American Maritime Partnership said in a statement on Thursday . 
The Energy Department updated the terms of the oil sale on Friday morning , saying there would no longer be an automatic waiver of the U.S. shipping law . 
The department said there would be plenty of U.S.-flagged vessels available to move the crude .
