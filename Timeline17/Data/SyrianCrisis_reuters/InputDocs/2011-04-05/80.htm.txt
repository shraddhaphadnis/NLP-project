Britain 's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg speaks to the media at Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City March 29 , 2011 . 
LONDON | Tue Apr 5 , 2011 12:08 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Internships in the civil service and business should be offered as widely as possible to boost social mobility and stop them being monopolised by well-connected families , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Tuesday . 
In many professions , a period as an intern can greatly increase an applicant 's chances of winning a permanent job . 
However , the government is concerned that such openings are often unadvertised and end up being offered to the children and friends of existing employees , restricting the diversity of the intake . 
`` For too long , internships have been the almost exclusive preserve of the sharp-elbowed and the well-connected , '' Clegg said as he launched the 11-month-old coalition 's social mobility strategy . 
`` Unfair , informal internships can rig the market in favor of those who already have opportunities . 
A country that is socially mobile bases opportunity on your ability and drive , not on who your father 's friends are , '' he added . 
The government has pledged to improve social mobility , which it says fell under the 13-year administration of Labor . 
As part of the strategy , the civil service will end the practice of informal internships by 2012 . 
Instead , all government department internships will be advertised on a central website . 
Several companies have also signed a `` Business Compact , '' committing them to ensure their internship schemes reach a wide audience , including Channel 4 television , The Guardian newspaper , and consultants KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers .
