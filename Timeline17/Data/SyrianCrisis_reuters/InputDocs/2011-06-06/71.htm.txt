SINGAPORE | Mon Jun 6 , 2011 6:09 am BST SINGAPORE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rolls-Royce -LRB- RR . 
L -RRB- is set to build a new engine to beef up the A350 jetliner being developed by Airbus in a costly rethink of strategy for Europe 's most ambitious new plane project , industry sources said on Monday . 
Airlines have criticized the planemaker 's one-size-fits-all policy that would see the mid-sized A350 built in three separate models all using the same engine , the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB . 
Until now , Airbus and Rolls have defended the engine as an all-rounder capable of powering twinjet A350 planes carrying 270 to 350 people , competing with two different types of planes manufactured by rival Boeing -LRB- BA . 
But the range needed from one type of engine became daunting as airlines called for more thrust for the largest A350-1000 , allowing it to fly further with more weight . 
`` My understanding is that Rolls-Royce has agreed to build a new engine , '' the chief executive of a major A350 customer told Reuters at an airline industry event . 
A spokesman for Airbus declined comment . 
A spokesman for Rolls-Royce in Singapore was not available for comment . 
A new engine typically costs up to $ 2 billion to develop , according to engine industry executives . 
An industry source familiar with the project told Reuters in November that Rolls was looking at two variants of the same engine , which would be less costly than building from scratch . 
But it remained unclear how many components would be shared between old and new models or who would pay for the upgrade . 
The head of a second customer airline said he was awaiting details of the changes to the A350 , but noted Airbus needed to juggle several variables to get the technical ingredients right . 
One of the world 's most influential aircraft buyers , leasing magnate Steven Udvar-Hazy , said he expected Airbus to modify its plans for the A350 and that this could lead to delays . 
`` They have to address payload , range and runway performance , '' the chief executive of Air Lease Corp -LRB- AL. . 
N -RRB- told Reuters . 
PA -RRB- last week reaffirmed plans to deliver the first A350 to be produced , the 314-seat A350-900 , in late 2013 . 
It did not address the delivery schedule for the other models , the 270-seat A350-800 and the 350-seat A350-1000 . 
Airbus last month canceled a media briefing on the A350 and said it would issue an update at the Paris Air Show in June . 
The aircraft has undergone numerous design changes in its history . 
The Trent XWB is the latest and physically largest member of the Rolls engine family which powers the world 's biggest jets . 
With a fan wider than Concorde 's fuselage and built to devour more than a tonne of air every second , the engine claims to be among the most powerful and flexible in civil aviation . 
But engines are designed to work most efficiently in a certain band of thrust and critics have said the Trent XWB would find it difficult to operate efficiently across all three types of A350 , even before the A350-1000 is beefed up . 
First indications of a change in strategy were disclosed by industry sources in November . 
The final decision could set the tone for the engine market in the next decade , with implications for the rivalry between Airbus and Boeing . 
Airlines say a beefed-up A350-1000 would be better able to compete with the Boeing 777 mini-jumbo , one of Boeing 's most successful models , while the smaller A350-800 and A350-900 aim to tackle the 787 Dreamliner , due to enter service this year . 
Rolls ' rival General Electric -LRB- GE . 
N -RRB- is the monopoly supplier on the current key 777 model , the Boeing 777-300ER .
