Syrian man turns himself in after trip to Tel Aviv JERUSALEM | Mon May 16 , 2011 3:14 pm EDT JERUSALEM -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A man identifying himself as a Syrian civil servant said on Monday he hitch-hiked and rode a bus alongside Israeli soldiers to Tel Aviv after pushing through an Israeli frontier fence with Palestinian demonstrators . 
`` It was my dream to reach Jaffa , '' Hassan Hijazi , 28 , said on Israel 's Channel 10 TV , from the biblical city now a section of Israel 's commercial hub , 215 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- from the Golan Heights where he had penetrated from Syria on Sunday . 
Hijazi , who later surrendered to Israeli police who said he was being questioned , was among dozens who penetrated Israeli-held territory in a protest marking Israel 's founding , a day mourned by Palestinians as a `` nakba '' or catastrophe . 
Similar protests were staged across the Lebanese and Gaza borders with Israel , and deadly confrontations ensued with Israeli forces in which 13 people were killed . 
Many of those who broke through a fence in the Golan Heights , which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally , had already been apprehended . 
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said that in addition to Hijazi who has turned himself in , three more Syrian nationals were arrested on Monday in the vicinity of Majdel Shams , the Golan Heights frontier village near where most had infiltrated . 
The channel said that Hijazi had gone to Jaffa in search of what had been his parents ' home before they joined the ranks of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee or be driven away during a war over the Jewish state 's founding in 1948 . 
He told of how after hitch-hiking in a minivan , he had also taken a public bus to the Israeli city , alongside uniformed Israeli combat soldiers . 
Asked about Israel 's objections to seeing Palestinian refugees and their offspring , who now number in the millions , returning to former homes , Hijazi replied : `` I imagine there are many Palestinians who do n't want to come back here , just like there are many Jews who also do n't want to stay .
