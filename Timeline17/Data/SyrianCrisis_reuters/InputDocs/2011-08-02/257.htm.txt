GUATEMALA CITY | Tue Aug 2 , 2011 10:44 pm EDT GUATEMALA CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Guatemala on Tuesday sentenced four soldiers to 6,060 years of prison each , in the first conviction for a massacre during the country 's brutal 36-year civil war . 
More than 200 people were killed when Guatemalan soldiers attacked the northern village of Las Dos Erres in 1982 at the height of Guatemala 's civil war . 
The soldiers were given 30 years of prison for the deaths of each of the 201 killed in the attack . 
The court also found them guilty of crimes against human rights , adding another 30 years to their sentences . 
The soldiers -- Carlos Carias , Manuel Pop , Reyes Collin Gualip and Daniel Martinez Hernandez -- were all special forces officers at the time of the massacre . 
The officers , in an elite unit known as the Kaibiles , went to the village in December 1982 and shot , strangled and bludgeoned the villagers to death with sledgehammers . 
Guatemala 's Public Ministry said the army ordered the unit to the village to look for missing military weapons , believed to be in the hands of left-wing guerillas . 
Last month , the United States deported former Guatemalan soldier Pedro Pimentel Rios , 54 , for his alleged role in the Las Dos Erres massacre . 
Guatemala 's Public Ministry will hold a separate hearing for Rios . 
The ruling center-left administration of President Alvaro Colom has been under pressure by human rights organizations to bring war criminals to justice in Guatemala , one of the poorest and most lawless countries in Latin America . 
Nearly a quarter of a million people were killed in Guatemala 's 1960-1996 civil war and many thousands are still missing .
