-LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China released its 2010 census results on Thursday , the first comprehensive review of the country 's demographics in a decade . 
Population experts have been warning that China could face potentially disastrous social and economic problems as the population ages and the number of Chinese of working age shrinks . 
The following compares some key facts from the 2010 census with results of the 2000 census . 
\* The 2010 census puts mainland China 's -LRB- not including Hong Kong and Macau or Taiwan -RRB- total population at 1.34 billion , an increase of 5.84 percent from 2000 . 
\* That 's a sharply slower rate of growth than the 2000 census showed . 
China 's 2000 census put the country 's total population at 1.265 billion , a rise of 11.7 percent over the 1990 figure . 
\* The annual growth rate was 0.57 percent in the decade to 2010 , compared with 1.07 percent in 1991-2000 . 
\* The total population including Hong Kong , Macau and Taiwan in 2010 was 1,370,536,875 . 
The report did not say how census-takers had compiled the data for Taiwan , which is a self-ruled island over which Beijing claims control . 
\* The government says 10 million workers were involved in conducting the census -- a figure similar to the previous census in 2000 . 
Earlier reports had said the number of census workers this time was 6 million but it is not clear which categories of workers are covered by the different figures . 
\* In 2010 , 16.60 percent of the population was 14 or younger , a sharp decline from 22.89 percent in 2000 . 
\* The old-age population continued to increase as a proportion of the whole , with citizens aged 60 or more accounting for 13.26 percent , 2.93 percentage points higher than in 2000 . 
\* In 2010 , 8.87 percent were 65 or older , compared with 6.96 percent in 2000 and 5.57 percent in 1990 . 
\* The 2010 census marks the first time China counted migrant workers based on where they lived and worked , not the location of their national household registration , or hukou . 
\* In 2010 , 221.4 million people had left the locality of their registered address for more than six months . 
That represented a rise of 100.36 million -- or 82.89 percent -- over the 2000 figure . 
\* Calculating China 's `` floating population '' hampered census workers in 2000 , but experts estimated that the country had about 200 million migrant workers at the time . 
\* China had 105.20 males for every 100 females , with females accounting for 48.73 percent of the total . 
\* In 2000 , China had 106.74 males to every 100 females . 
Experts said this disparity was due to China 's family planning policies , which encouraged under-reporting of female births and the practice of self-selective abortion after the sex of a child was determined using an ultrasound . 
\* Nearly half of the population -- 49.7 percent live in urban areas , showing a rapidly urbanising China . 
\* In 2000 , 36.09 percent of Chinese lived in cities , an increase of 9.86 percent points over the figure from the 1990 census . 
That figure used a different counting method than the 2010 census , however , which counts migrant workers living in cities . 
\* The 2010 census showed the population of the eastern region grew to 37.98 percent from 35.57 percent in 2000 . 
The other regions -- central , western and northeastern China -- all saw their populations decline as a percentage of China 's total population . 
\* Since 2000 , the decline in western China was the fastest , falling 1.11 percentage points . 
\* No information was given about which provinces were included in which regions . 
\* The top five provinces remained the same , but Guangdong jumped into first place , leap-frogging Shandong and Henan , which were the second and first most populous in 2010 . 
\* No data has been provided yet for the fertility rate in 2010 . 
\* China 's fertility rate , which stood at four births per mother in 1970 , was 1.82 in 2000 . 
\* China 's 55 registered ethnic groups , aside from the majority Han Chinese , accounted for 8.49 percent of the population , up from 8.41 percent in 2000 . 
\* The average annual growth of the minority population was 0.67 percent , compared with 0.11 percent in the Han majority . 
\* In 2010 , the number of people with a university education was 8,930 per 100,000 , almost 2.5 times more than in 2000 , when it stood at 3,611 . 
\* In 2010 , the illiteracy rate of people 15 years of age or older was 4.08 percent . 
\* China 's illiteracy rate was 6.72 percent in 2000 , and 15.88 percent in 1990 .
