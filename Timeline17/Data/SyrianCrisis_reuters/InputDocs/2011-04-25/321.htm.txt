LONDON | Mon Apr 25 , 2011 7:45 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain has decided against inviting a Libyan representative to the wedding this week of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey , official sources said on Monday . 
An invitation to Libya 's ambassador was prepared before the conflict in the country intensified in March but was not delivered , according to the sources . 
The decision not to issue the invitation to the wedding on Friday was made by the Foreign Office which is dealing with the issue of which foreign dignitaries should attend , they said . 
Protocol dictates that all ambassadors based in London should be invited unless there is a diplomatic problem . 
Representatives of Iran and Zimbabwe , for example , have been invited despite strained relations with Britain in the past . 
`` All heads of mission in London representing countries with which we are in normal diplomatic relations have been invited to the royal wedding , '' a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said . 
Britain expelled five Libyan diplomats last month , judging their presence could pose a threat to national security . 
However , Libya 's ambassador and other embassy staff remain . 
On Sunday , Bahrain 's crown prince said he would not attend the wedding because of unrest in the Gulf Arab kingdom , defusing a potentially embarrassing row over his invitation .
