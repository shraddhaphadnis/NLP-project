JOHANNESBURG | Wed May 25 , 2011 10:00 am BST JOHANNESBURG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - South African President Jacob Zuma will visit Tripoli next week for talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , the presidency said in a statement on Wednesday . 
Johannesburg-based Talk Radio 702 earlier reported that the aim of the visit was to discuss an exit strategy for Gaddafi but the presidency statement made no mention of that . 
`` President Zuma will stop over in Tripoli for a discussion with Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , on the 30th of May , in his capacity as a member of the African Union High Level Panel for the Resolution of the conflict in Libya , '' the statement said . 
The South African president headed an African Union mission to Tripoli in April but the AU bid to halt the civil war collapsed within hours . 
A South African government official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the aim of the latest effort from the African Union was `` to seek a breakthrough . '' 
France and the United States have made upbeat assessments on progress towards ending Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
Talk Radio 702 , citing sources in Tripoli , said Zuma 's visit was in cooperation with Turkey but in Ankara the Turkish Foreign Ministry said there had been no contact on the visit . 
Last week , South Africa accused Libya of misleading it over the fate of a South African photographer now believed to be dead after being shot and abandoned in the desert by forces loyal to Gaddafi . 
South Africa 's ruling African National Congress said it was incensed by the use of deadly force against civilians and journalists and accused Libya of dishonesty .
