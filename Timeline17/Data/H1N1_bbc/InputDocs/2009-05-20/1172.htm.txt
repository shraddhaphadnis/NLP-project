These students do n't look overly worried about swine flu The global pandemic that is Influenza H1N1 , more commonly known as swine flu , continues its rapid and virulent spread . 
The World Health Organisation reported the number of infected people to have reached 9,830 across 40 countries . 
The virus , which is thought to have originated in Mexico , has now spread as far south as Australia and as far east as Japan . 
With over 170 reported cases , Japan has one of the highest instances of infection in Asia . 
In response , Japan , like many other badly infected regions , has tried to contain any further spread of the virus . 
One measure taken has been the temporary closure of 4,000 schools , colleges and nurseries in and around Hyogo and Osaka . 
Students have been advised to stay at home until further notice but a few restless individuals have found a more entertaining and musical way to spend their new-found free time . 
It appears some Japanese students are not spending their time worrying about the virus , but spending it practising their singing instead . 
In fact , a few karaoke club owners in Japan have reported record numbers of customers . 
One club manager told the AFP news agency : `` We suddenly had a number of high school students after 2pm yesterday , right after the announcement that schools would close for a week . '' 
Neither students nor club owners appear overly worried about the virus . 
So just how concerned should they be ? 
Well , according to a recent statement from Dr Margaret Chan , Director General of the World Health Organization : `` With the exception of the outbreak in Mexico , which is still not fully understood , the H1N1 virus tends to cause very mild illness in otherwise healthy people . 
Outside Mexico , nearly all cases of illness , and all deaths , have been detected in people with underlying chronic conditions . ''
