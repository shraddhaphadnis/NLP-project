Khanzir was given to the zoo by China in 2002 Afghanistan 's only known pig has been quarantined because of fears over swine flu , officials from Kabul Zoo say . 
The pig , a curiosity in a country where pork products are illegal , lives at the zoo , where he had previously enjoyed grazing next to deer and goats . 
However visitors expressed fears that the animal could be carrying the H1N1 virus and he was moved into isolation . 
The director of the zoo , Aziz Gul Saqib , says the pig , whose name is Khanzir , is strong and healthy . 
Speaking to the BBC World Service , Mr Saqib says : `` The only reason we moved him was because Afghan people do n't have a lot of knowledge about swine flu , and so when they see a pig they get worried and think they will get ill . '' 
The animal , known simply as Khanzir , the Pashtu word for pig , was given to the zoo by China in 2002 . 
The zoo director says Khanzir has been moved to a large space with lots of windows and fresh air and that he hopes the pig will be quarantined for only a few days . 
Acknowledging that being Afghanistan 's only pig is a lonely existence , Mr Saqib says he hopes to find Khanzir a female companion soon . 
However , he says , because of swine flu , `` it is a dangerous and difficult time to get a new pig for our pig '' .
