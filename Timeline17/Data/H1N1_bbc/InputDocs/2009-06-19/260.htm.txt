Panic over Uganda swine flu hoax South Africa is the only sub-Saharan country with a confirmed swine flu case A hoax text message warning people that swine flu had broken out in Uganda has caused panic and confusion this week . 
It purported to come from the health ministry , told people not to eat pork and promised free airtime for those who passed the message to 25 other people . 
The ministry held a press conference denying the `` baseless rumor '' . 
But the BBC 's Ignatius Bahizi in the capital , Kampala , says the confusion persisted as the ministry often uses texts to spread its health messages . 
The Daily Monitor newspaper reports that the hoax message was even debated in parliament . 
Our reporter , who received the text on Tuesday night from a friend , says he took it seriously at first . 
`` Ministry of Health warning ; to avoid swine flu which is suspected to be already in Uganda , you are advised not to eat pork or be near pigs for the time being . 
The first case reported in Ggaba and Nakulabye . 
Send this message to 25 people and MTN will reward you with airtime , '' it said . 
The ministry released its statement the next day and stressed that well-prepared pork was safe to eat . 
Our reporter says people were surprised it hear the text was a scam . 
Only recently a health ministry text message warned people about a polio outbreak and urged people to get immunised . 
But correspondents say the scam is now the source of some amusement . 
Sub-Saharan Africa 's first case of the H1N1 virus was reported in South Africa on Thursday .
