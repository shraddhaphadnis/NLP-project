Manny Pacquiao knocked out Britain 's Ricky Hatton last weekend Health officials in the Philippines have asked the country 's star boxer to delay his return from the US as a precaution against swine flu . 
Manny Pacquiao was scheduled to return home on Friday , after his knockout victory against Britain 's Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas at the weekend . 
But Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque urged the champion to postpone his flight . 
There is no suggestion that the boxer actually has swine flu . 
But his fight last weekend was in Las Vegas , where confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported . 
The health secretary told reporters he wanted Mr Pacquiao to delay his triumphal return to the Philippines until at least next Tuesday . 
Mr Duque explained that it takes about five days for swine flu symptoms to appear , and he was hoping Mr Pacquiao and his entourage would impose `` self-quarantine '' until then , to be absolutely sure they had not contracted the virus . 
The Philippines was due to hold a `` national day of celebration '' for Mr Pacquiao this Friday , in honor of his win . 
But Mr Duque said there were concerns that the motorcade , which was due to drive through Manila in celebration , could pose a risk of spreading the virus . 
There are no confirmed swine flu cases in the Philippines , although some patients are under observation . 
According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization , nearly 1,500 people around the globe have been infected with swine flu , most of them in Mexico . 
Two fatalities have been reported in the United States .
