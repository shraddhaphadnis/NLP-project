Is a low energy house really possible ? 
Plus , how does the swine flu model work ? 
; the new anti-biotic technique ; and why we are safer than we thought from inter-planetary collision . 
All new housing must be zero-carbon by 2016 according to government policy , but is such a commitment even meaningful ? 
The aim seems worthy , but experts say that new homes often use twice the energy expected , partly because the engineering science is too poor . 
As the UK research councils pour new money into eco-engineering , Quentin Cooper hears about the challenges of low-carbon housing . 
The WHO appear likely to announce that the H1N1 swine flu outbreak has indeed reached pandemic level . 
Quentin speaks to the epidemiologist who published , in the journal Science , some of the first predictions . 
Is it turning out as they expected ? 
A compound designed to attack the DNA of cancer cells failed . 
Instead , researchers at the University of Warwick tried it out on infectious bacteria , and it killed them in minutes . 
Could it be the new secret weapon in our dwindling anti-biotic arsenal ? 
Plus the news stories of impending planetary collision , albeit in billions of years time , are examined . 
Actually , the work published in the journal Nature , the result of some of the most powerful computing in the world , suggests to astronomers that inter-planetary collision is instead less likely than they feared .
