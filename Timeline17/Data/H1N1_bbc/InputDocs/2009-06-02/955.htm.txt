Firms are hard at work on a vaccine The number of swine flu cases in the UK has climbed to more than 330 . 
The Health Protection Agency recorded more than 60 new cases alone on Tuesday , and although nobody has yet died from the virus , experts are warning against any complacency . 
And the hard work is only just beginning for scientists developing a vaccine . 
At the west London office of the drug giant GSK , there is a special unit for global planning on flu pandemic vaccines . 
A special sample of the swine flu or H1N1 virus has arrived at GSK in the past week , allowing scientists to begin a detailed analysis . 
The UK medical director , Dr Pim Kon , told me the six-month process has many uncertainties . 
Although the company has agreed to provide 60m doses of a vaccine , it is not yet known how many people that will cover . 
Dr Kon said : `` That is still to be determined , as it is based on how the production goes . 
The vaccine will be based on certain parts of the virus , so they 'll need to see whether those parts change `` The scientists will also be keeping a very close eye on whether the virus mutates . 
`` The vaccine will be based on certain parts of the virus , so they 'll need to see whether those parts change . '' 
The detailed scientific work is being done at GSK 's plant in Belgium , while executives in London negotiate global contracts . 
Health experts are monitoring H1N1 cases in countries like Brazil , where winter and normal `` seasonal '' flu is just beginning . 
Professor Ab Osterhaus , who is based in Rotterdam , has studied flu viruses for half of his 30-year career , and predicts various tensions in the months ahead . 
He said : `` If you start to produce the pandemic flu vaccine , it will go at the cost of the seasonal flu vaccine . 
`` Seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the world every year - so we still have a responsibility there as well . 
If we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures `` The production capacity is limited , and vaccines have to be produced within six months . 
`` There is likely to be competition between countries . 
`` The richer countries have ordered pre-pandemic vaccine . 
That is not the case for countries that do n't have so many resources . 
`` So if we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures . 
`` It 's a major issue for the World Health Organisation to consider . '' 
The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , has warned that H1N1 may be spreading in the community - despite efforts to contain it among known travellers and their contacts . 
Previous pandemics have started in a mild fashion , but developed in waves . 
You wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf And although the figures do not now lead news bulletins , the number of swine flu cases continues to rise each day . 
After the initial flurry of coverage , questions were raised about whether the threat posed by H1N1 had been over-hyped . 
That is firmly denied by the health editor of the Independent newspaper , Jeremy Laurance , who wrote a strident front-page piece a month ago . 
He told me : `` People say there are only two kinds of medical story - the miracle cure and the deadly scare . 
`` You wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf . 
`` I felt there was a real need to answer that charge - and that 's why I wrote the piece I did . 
`` This is a wholly new virus that we have n't seen before . 
`` And it 's estimated a third of the world 's population wo n't have immunity to it . 
`` That 's why we need to take it seriously . '' 
And in the meantime , the NHS is learning lessons . 
A leading light in the BMA doctors ' union , Dr Jonathan Fielden , works in intensive care at a busy hospital in the Home Counties . 
Dr Fielden said : `` We had a case of concern which led us to ensure we had special masks which were properly fitted . 
`` They give a higher level of protection than the masks we use in theater . 
`` So far , it 's been a useful test of our procedures , in circumstances where the flu has n't been severe at this stage . 
`` Our concern , as we come to the normal flu season in the winter , is that many of our resources are already under pressure . 
`` Although there 's been an increase in intensive care beds , we still have some of the lowest numbers in Europe per head of population . 
`` Those beds are often under great stress in normal circumstances - and in these circumstances , there will be pressure throughout the system . ''
