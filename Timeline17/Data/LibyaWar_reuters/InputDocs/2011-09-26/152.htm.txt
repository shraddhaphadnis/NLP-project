Mon Sep 26 , 2011 5:35 pm EDT CALGARY , Alberta -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Suncor Energy Inc said on Monday it is still unwilling to send its employees back to Libya even though its joint-venture partner there is getting ready to resume oil production in the strife-torn country . 
Kelli Stevens , a spokeswoman for Suncor , said the company has been in contact with partner Harouge Oil Operations `` and we 're aware of them taking steps to restart production '' . 
Stevens said Suncor is still concerned about the safety and security of its employees in Libya , and none of the expatriate employees it evacuated in February have yet returned . 
Oil production in Libya is resuming as forces of the National Transitional Council consolidate their control and sweep out Muammar Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists . 
Libya 's oil industry can restart without foreign firms , but analysts say a speedy return to prewar output of 1.6 million barrels per day will depend on their return . 
Suncor 's share of its exploration and production sharing agreements with Libya 's National Oil Co averaged about 35,000 bpd before civil war disrupted operations . 
It picked up the fields in the Sirte Basin of Libya in its 2010 acquisition of Petro-Canada . 
The company wrote down the value of the operations in July by C$ 514 million -LRB- $ 500 million -RRB- . 
The book value is now about C$ 400 million . 
Suncor shares were up 51 Canadian cents , or 2 percent , at C$ 26.83 by late morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
