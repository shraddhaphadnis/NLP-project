RABAT | Sun Feb 20 , 2011 6:47 pm EST RABAT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi promised a program of reforms on Sunday after bloody protests against his father 's rule reached the capital . 
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success , also hit out at those behind the violence , which has cost more than 200 lives over the past few days , according to human rights groups . 
He said protests against his father 's rule , which have been concentrated in the east of the country , threatened to sink Libya into civil war and split the country up into several small states . 
Saif al-Islam also acknowledged -- in the first such admission by a Libyan official -- that the police and army made mistakes in dealing with the protests . 
But he said reports of hundreds killed were an exaggeration . 
He said the General People 's Congress , Libya 's equivalent of a parliament , would convene on Monday to discuss a `` clear '' reform agenda , while the government would also raise wages .
