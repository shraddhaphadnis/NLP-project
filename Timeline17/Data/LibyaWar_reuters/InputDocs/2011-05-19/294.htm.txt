LONDON | Thu May 19 , 2011 11:32 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The European Union is considering tightening sanctions on the government of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi by blacklisting ports to prevent exports of oil and imports of fuel , a Western diplomatic source told Reuters . 
The source said European Union experts have reached an agreement over putting the Libyan ports of Tripoli , Zuara , Zawiyah , Al-Khoms , Ras Lanuf and Brega on the sanctions list and proposals could be submitted to the EU sanctions committee next week . 
Gaddafi 's government is seeking to raise fuel imports by using a loophole in international sanctions after two months of western air strikes against Libya . . 
Civil war has crippled the refining industry and Gaddafi urgently needs fuel imports for his military and to keep civilian vehicles running in the areas he controls . 
`` West Libya 's supply of refined products is still sufficient . 
Western powers want a lot more control over supplies to Libya , '' the source said . 
`` The concern is that a stalemate will ensue in the war . '' 
The discussions will likely take place at the level of the EU sanctions committee next week and could become law by early June if it is successful , he said . 
The discussions may also involve the Libyan state-owned shipping company General National Maritime Transport Company -LRB- GNMTC -RRB- which is not on the sanctions list and has managed to bring at least one fuel cargo into west Libya .
