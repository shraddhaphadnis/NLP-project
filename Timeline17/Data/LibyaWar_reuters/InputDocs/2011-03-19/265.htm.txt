Neverthele ss , despite it being well into the 21st Century , it has begun -- again . 
And soon Nato forces , in tandem with other countries , will have to send in thousands of troops to train the new Libyan military as well as what will be called `` restoring order '' . 
Ten years from now , based on history , we will be asking -- again -- how long this expensive fight will last . 
Meanwhile , the first 110 American cruise missiles , probably worth a couple of hundred million dollars , have been launched as just the first phase of the attack to end the Libyan civil war , under the guise of protecting what many people are probably calling our side , even though it is essentiall y a war between tribes whose civilian population s are aligned along tribal lines rather than being democratic freedom fighters as the West likes to call them . 
However , one can hope this civil war will end sooner than appears likely .
