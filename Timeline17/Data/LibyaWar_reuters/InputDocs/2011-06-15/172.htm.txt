RABAT , June 15 | Wed Jun 15 , 2011 10:29 pm BST RABAT , June 15 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's government approved a $ 31.4 billion budget for the rest of 2011 , the official news agency said on Wednesday , a move apparently aimed at showing it was functioning as normal despite air strikes and sanctions . 
Jana said the funds would `` provide the necessary financial sources to cover the state 's expenditure for the rest of the year '' and would be distributed to the country 's 22 districts . 
It said just under half of the total 37.65 billion dinars -LRB- $ 31.4 billion -RRB- would be used to pay salaries . 
It appeared to be an attempt by Muammar Gaddafi to show his government was still solvent despite a civil war pitting his forces against rebels looking to end his 41-year rule . 
Libya 's former central bank governor Farhat Bengdara , who defected in March was quoted this week , as saying the Gaddafi government had just $ 500 million left in cash at the end of February , although it still held about 155 tonnes of gold bars . 
An International Monetary Fund report put Libya 's net foreign assets held by the central bank and the sovereign wealth fund at $ 150 billion at the end of 2010 . 
Some of these assets were abroad and have been seized as part of sanctions against Libya . 
That still leaves Gaddafi with a large pile of currency , but with no new foreign exchange coming in from the sale of oil -- which is also blocked by sanctions -- those reserves will dwindle .
