NEW YORK | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 5:35 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - World stocks eked out a gain on Monday , stabilizing after the previous four weeks of sharp losses , while Brent crude prices slipped on prospects Libya 's civil war will soon end . 
U.S. stocks struggled to end barely higher , while gold , a traditional safe haven , hit a third consecutive all-time high near $ 1,900 after staging its biggest weekly gain in 2-1\/2 years last week . 
Sharp volatility in stocks , which has marked trading in recent weeks , underscored investor nervousness . 
The turmoil largely reflects persistent worries that the United States may fall back into recession , as well as the threat that sovereign debt problems in euro zone peripheral countries could spread to the larger economies . 
The cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one another rose again , heading back toward their highest levels since late 2008 as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to European counterparts in the face of the intractable debt crisis . 
`` The ground zero of all worries is financials , '' said Charlie Smith , chief investment officer at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group . 
Bank stocks , seen as most vulnerable to the debt crisis in Europe , underperformed other sectors . 
JPMorgan Chase -LRB- JPM . 
N -RRB- fell 2.7 percent to $ 33.41 and was the top drag on the Dow , followed by Bank of America -LRB- BAC . 
N -RRB- , down 7.9 percent at $ 6.42 . 
Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his Friday speech at a central banker conference in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , to signal a new monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy . 
That helped support stocks and gold but weigh on U.S. bond prices . 
Bernanke , however , is most likely to outline gradualist measures , which would disappoint those looking for a big-bang approach such as a fresh round of bond buying , known as QE3 . 
The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bank could tweak the Fed 's balance sheet as a means to put further pressure on medium and long-term interest rates and anchor them at low levels . 
These could be implemented in September and October at coming Fed meetings . 
`` The Fed is definitely on people 's minds , and you could argue that some of the bounce seen in high-yield commodity currencies is at least in part related to hopes for more policy measures , '' said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov in New York .

But U.S. crude oil settled higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

`` Gold is driven by the expectation that at some point inflation will come back , and a continuation of people looking for a safe haven beside just the U.S. Treasury bonds , '' said Leo Larkin , metals equity analyst at Standard & Poor 's .
