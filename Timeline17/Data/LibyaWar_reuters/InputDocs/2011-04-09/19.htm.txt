WASHINGTON | Sat Apr 9 , 2011 11:46 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Libyan opposition group is asking the United States for immediate access to frozen assets of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to pay for humanitarian needs in rebel-held areas . 
Ali Aujali , who resigned in February as Libya 's ambassador to the United States and now heads Libya 's most prominent rebel organization , in a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the humanitarian conditions have deteriorated in areas held by the rebels . 
Rebel groups seeking to overthrow the Libyan leader have been fighting pro-Gaddafi forces in a civil war ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies . 
Aujali , in the letter dated Thursday , said his group , the transitional national council , `` needs immediate access to the Gaddafi regime 's frozen assets in U.S. financial institutions to meet the basic needs of the Libyan people . '' 
The United States has frozen more than $ 34 billion in assets as part of sanctions against Gaddafi and his top officials . 
The Treasury Department on Friday added five senior officials -- Libya 's prime minister , finance minister , oil minister , internal security director and Gaddafi 's chief of staff -- and two entities controlled by Gaddafi 's children to its sanctions blacklist . 
Obama administration officials have said they were looking into whether some of the frozen cash , securities and other financial instruments could be used to aid the Libyan rebel effort .
