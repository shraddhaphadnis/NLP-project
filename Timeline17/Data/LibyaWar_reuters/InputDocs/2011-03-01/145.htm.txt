Tue Mar 1 , 2011 6:36 pm EST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya could descend into civil war unless Muammar Gaddafi quits , the United States said on Tuesday , its demand for his departure intensifying pressure on the longtime leader after news of Western military preparations . 
Gaddafi remained defiant , dispatching forces to a western border area amid fears that the most violent Arab revolt may grow bloodier and cause a humanitarian crisis . 
Tunisian border guards fired into the air on Tuesday to try to control a crowd of people clamoring to cross the frontier and escape the violence . 
About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir border post in the past two weeks , and many more of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in Libya are expected to follow . 
Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam warned the West against launching any military action to topple Gaddafi , and said the veteran ruler would not step down or go into exile . 
`` Using force against Libya is not acceptable . 
There 's no reason , but if they want ... we are ready , we are not afraid , '' he told Sky television , adding : `` We live here , we die here . '' 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told U.S. lawmakers : `` Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war . '' 
She said the Obama administration would look into allegations that Gaddafi personally ordered the 1988 Lockerbie bombing , because of new statements by defecting Libyan officials `` making it clear that the order came from the very top . ''
