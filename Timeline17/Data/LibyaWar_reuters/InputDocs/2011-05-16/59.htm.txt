Eni CEO sees Libya `` problem '' over in a year : report MILAN | Mon May 16 , 2011 3:24 am EDT MILAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italian oil firm Eni SpA expects the `` Libyan problem '' to be over in a year and is not worried for the longer term , Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said in an interview published on Monday . 
Eni , the biggest foreign oil business operator in Libya , has said it expects the civil war in the North African nation to cut its production total for the full year after an almost 9 percent drop in the first quarter . 
`` Personally , I have no doubt that one year from now the Libyan problem will be behind us , '' Scaroni told the Financial Times . 
He added : `` I am still not worried about the future . 
I 'm worried about the present because the political situation in Libya is difficult , there is no possibility of producing in Libya and , as a consequence , the only activity is to protect our installations there . '' 
Scaroni said he had not the `` smallest doubt '' that once political order is re-established in Libya , Eni 's position will be as strong as it has been in the past , whoever will be in charge , the newspaper said . 
Eni gets about 13 percent of its oil and gas production from Libya .
