ALGIERS | Tue Aug 30 , 2011 6:02 am EDT ALGIERS Aug 30 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Algeria is to close the southern part of its border with Libya , a local newspaper reported on Tuesday , the day after Algeria angered Libya 's new rulers by giving safe haven to members of Muammar Gaddafi 's family . 
Algeria announced on Monday that Gaddafi 's wife , two of his sons and his daughter had crossed into its territory , prompting Libya 's ruling interim council to demand that they be handed back to face trial . 
Algeria 's El Watan newspaper , quoting diplomatic sources , said an instruction had gone out to security services to close the southern part of the border with Libya , because of the `` precarious situation '' in Libya . 
The Algerian government could not immediately be reached for comment . 
Algeria 's border with Libya is hundreds of kilometres long and stretches through vast expanses of empty desert . 
Algerian officials say they are concerned that Islamist militants have infiltrated Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , and that al Qaeda 's North African wing will exploit the chaos in Libya to acquire weapons and explosives . 
The NTC has angrily denied those charges and in turn accuses Algeria of siding with Muammar Gaddafi during Libya 's civil war , something the Algerian authorities deny . 
The whereabouts of Gaddafi , deposed by the NTC after 42 years in power , are unknown .
