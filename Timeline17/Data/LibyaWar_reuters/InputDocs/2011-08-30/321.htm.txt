UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's interim leadership has rejected the idea of deploying any kind of international military force or observers , the U.N. special envoy on post-conflict planning for Libya said on Tuesday . 
`` We do n't now expect military observers to be requested by the -LRB- Libyan interim leadership -RRB- , '' envoy Ian Martin told reporters after attending a closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council . 
`` It 's very clear that the Libyans want to avoid any kind of military deployment of the U.N. or others , '' he said . 
Earlier on Tuesday Mustafa Abdel Jalil , chairman of the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , said that Libya did not need outside help to maintain security . 
Martin , however , said the United Nations expected that the NTC would ask it to help establish a police force . 
`` They are very seriously interested in assistance with policing to get the public security situation under control and gradually develop a democratically accountable public security force , '' Martin said . 
The Libyan civil war is not over yet . 
Although forces who fought for six months to depose former ruler Muammar Gaddafi now control most of the country , Gaddafi 's forces are holding out in a few Libyan towns , even though their leader has gone to ground and most of his family has fled the country .
