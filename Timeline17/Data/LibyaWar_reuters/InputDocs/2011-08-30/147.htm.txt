Libya sees oil output at pre-war levels in 15 months BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue Aug 30 , 2011 11:43 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's oil production can restart within weeks and reach full pre-war output within 15 months , the newly-appointed chairman of the country 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- said on Tuesday . 
`` Starting up production will be within weeks , not months . 
After we start it will take less than 15 months -LRB- to reach full output -RRB- , '' Nouri Berouin , chairman of the NOC , told Reuters at the headquarters of Libya 's ruling interim government , the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , in Benghazi . 
The OPEC member was producing 1.6 million barrels per day before an uprising began in February against leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
The civil war caused foreign workers to flee and some oilfields and export terminals were damaged . 
Berouin said most oilfields were `` fine '' and had not suffered major damage but that minefields around the Brega export terminal could slow the resumption of normal operations . 
`` Once our fields are secure we need to make sure we clear the mines . 
Building up output will require logistical support and we might need our foreign partners , '' he said . 
NTC fighters moved into Tripoli earlier this month but clashes with forces loyal to Gaddafi continue near the major coastal oil terminals of Es-Sider and Ras Lanuf . 
Oil contracts signed with the Libyan NOC before the war when it was under the leadership of Shokri Ghanem will be respected , Berouin said . 
`` I have met with international oil companies and the first thing I told them was that we respect all contracts , '' he said .
