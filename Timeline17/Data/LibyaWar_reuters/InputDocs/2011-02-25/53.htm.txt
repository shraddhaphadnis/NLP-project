NEW YORK | Fri Feb 25 , 2011 5:08 pm EST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brent oil rose in volatile trade on Friday to hold above $ 112 a barrel but below Thursday 's 2-1\/2 - year highs after Saudi Arabia raised output to calm fears of supply disruptions sparked by Libya 's uprising . 
Saudi Arabia has boosted output by more than 700,000 barrels per day , to a level exceeding 9 million bpd , a senior industry source familiar with Saudi production told Reuters . 
Worries about the worsening situation in Libya , where oil outages have risen to as much as three quarters of its 1.6 million bpd output , spurred short-covering before the weekend . 
Those moves were further stoked by news that the United States was imposing sanctions and cutting diplomatic ties with Libya as Muammar Gaddafi 's security forces cracked down against a widening revolt against his rule . 
`` I do n't think many traders are comfortable being short over the weekend , '' said Tom Bentz , a broker at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York . 
Estimates of Libya 's supply loss could not be confirmed , however , with conditions unsettled as rebels fought to wrest control of oilfields and terminals in the east of the country from Gaddafi loyalists . 
On Thursday , the disruptions pushed Brent to almost $ 120 and U.S. crude to more than $ 103 . 
Brent shot ahead as more of Libya 's oil exports go to European refiners than to those in the United States . 
In London , Brent futures for April closed up 78 cents at $ 112.14 a barrel , the highest weekly settlement since August 21 , 2008 . 
They peaked at $ 113.91 , below Thursday 's high of $ 119.79 , the loftiest intraday since August 2008 . 
U.S. April crude futures settled up 60 cents at $ 97.88 , the highest weekly close since September 2008 , and reached $ 99.20 earlier . 
That was well below Thursday 's intraday peak of $ 103.41 , also the highest since September 2008 . 
Brent 's premium against U.S. crude rose to $ 14.26 , from $ 14.08 at the close on Thursday , when the Brent spread against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rocketed to a record $ 16.91 . 
`` Fears that the unrest in Libya could turn into a civil war and wipe out its oil production have been offset by assurances from Saudi Arabia that it is raising output , '' said Gene McGillian , analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford , Connecticut . 
U.S. crude drew support from a rise in consumer confidence to a three-year high in February , suggesting the economy remained on a solid footing despite high gasoline prices , according to a ThomsonReuters\/University of Michigan survey . 
That optimism was tempered by the latest reading of fourth-quarter 2010 economic growth , which showed the U.S. economy grew more slowly than expected .
