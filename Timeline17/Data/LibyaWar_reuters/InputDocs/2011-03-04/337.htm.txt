TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan authorities blocked foreign journalists from leaving their hotel to report on expected protests by opponents of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi after Friday prayers . 
When journalists including Reuters reporters tried to walk out of the gates of the main media hotel , to the south of Tripoli city center , security guards blocked their way . 
A Libyan government spokesman said journalists were being kept in the Rixos hotel because their presence could trigger violence from what he described as affiliates of al Qaeda . 
`` These are exceptional circumstances . 
I know you 're going to talk about it and twist it the way you want , '' said the spokesman Mussa Ibrahim . 
`` We are preparing to pay this price of preventing you guys from reporting to avoid turning Tripoli into Baghdad . '' 
A revolt against Gaddafi 's four-decade rule has left the eastern side of the country , and several towns elsewhere , in rebel control with the capital now his principal strong-hold . 
Several residents of Tripoli have said they are planning to protest against Gaddafi when they leave their mosques after Friday prayers , and that they anticipate a violent crackdown by armed pro-Gaddafi militias . 
Overnight , gunshots could be heard outside the Rixos hotel . 
Ibrahim said the firing was an attempt by the rebels to disturb stability in central Tripoli . 
About 130 journalists are in the hotel after being invited to Libya on an officially-organized media visit . 
Their movements are monitored by officials .
