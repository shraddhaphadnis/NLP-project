closer', 'The work focused on an inherited form of heart disease, but scientists believe the same approach could work for other conditions caused by single gene mutations, such as cystic fibrosis and certain kinds of breast cancer', 'This embryo gene correction method, if proven safe, can potentially be used to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generations, said Paula Amato, a fertility specialist involved in the US-Korean study at Oregon Health and Science University', 'The scientists used a powerful gene editing tool called Crispr-Cas9 to fix mutations in embryos made with the sperm of a man who inherited a heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM', 'The disease, which leads to a thickening of the hearts muscular wall, affects one in 500 people

the same time as fertilisation, 42 out of 58 embryos, or 72%, were found to be free of the disease-causing mutation', 'The work has impressed other scientists in the field because in previous experiments, gene editing has worked only partially, mending harmful mutations in some cells, but not others', 'Another problem happens when the wrong genes are modified by mistake, but in the latest
